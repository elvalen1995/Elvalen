pos,"Listening to the 1975's ambitious, often frustrating third full-length album, 2018's A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, it's clear that the Manchester outfit is not the same band that delivered their effusive 2013 debut. They sound somewhat more akin to the band that issued 2016's I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It. If that album found lead singer Matt Healypushing the group's emo and post-punk influences ever pop-ward, embracing R&B and adult contemporary stylings, then A Brief Inquiry takes those changes even further. Some of these tracks, like ""TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME"" and ""Give Yourself a Try,"" sound like they could be demo recordings -- quickly captured song ideas rife with tinny programmed drums, electric guitars pushed a little too hot into the mix, and Healy's angsty croon buried in a gelatin haze of Auto-Tune. Elsewhere, they achieve a more grounded sophistication, offering up the sweet '90s R&B groove of ""Sincerity Is Scary"" and the dewy, jazz trumpet-accented ""Mine."" That both of these tracks wouldn't sound out of place on a D'Angelo album is a kind of triumph. ""It's Not a Living (If It's Not With You)"" comes the closest the sparkling sound of their early hits and goes even further in recreating the sugary Stock, Aitken & Waterman sound of 1989. Similarly, the gut-wrencher ""I Couldn't Be More in Love"" is straight-up Phil Collins pastiche.
Much like their ubiquitous self-titled theme song that subtly evolves with each album, the 1975 are a band of the moment, synthetic pop mavericks unburdened by any parochial genre constraints and able to drape themselves in an array of digital musical skins. It might be more easily dismissed as a savvy commercialism if the band wasn't so passionately committed to the process. Healy, who battled his own demons during the album's gestation, including entering rehab for heroin addiction, seems to be a man both at odds and in tune with his age. The album vibrates with tweetable immediacy, packing in a reference to the death of rapper Lil Peep next to heartfelt condemnations of immigrant bashing and timely references to the Me Too movement -- and that's all just in ""Love It If We Made It,"" a buoyantly earnest anthem that works as their own Internet-era version of Van Hagar's ""Right Now,"" Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" and Phil Collins' ""Another Day in Paradise."" Healy would love it if society survived to the next millennium, but as he sings on the song's chorus, ""modernity has failed us."" Much like the Internet itself, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships works best in small doses, when you can catch any one song on its own terms. And despite the often bleak themes at play on the album, there's also a refreshing hopefulness on many of the tracks that speaks to Healy's own recovery and willingness to say yes to even the most frothy pop trend. However, taken as a whole, the album is often as disparate and difficult to wade through as the social-media landscape it hopes to comment on.

"
pos,"you learn a couple of things when you get to my age,? announces Matt Healy, 29, a few minutes into the 1975?s third album. You suspect it is delivered with a wink to the camera. Nevertheless, the two and half years since their previous album, I Like It When You Sleep for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It have been eventful for the band?s frontman, taking in vast commercial success, heroin addiction and a spell in rehab.
Healy and the rest of the 1975 have reappeared with an album that clearly wants to be an epochal statement: the presence of a spoken-word track performed by Siri, Apple?s virtual assistant, and the distinctly Radiohead-like song I Always Wanna Die Sometimes implies it wants to be a millennial OK Computer. But behind the handwringing angst and existential despair, OK Computer was remarkably focused and direct. A Brief Enquiry Into Online Relationships feels more like the musical equivalent of a drunk early hours social media post, as a spew of unedited ideas veers from inspired to faintly regrettable.
There is a hugely impressive musical diversity on display, which seems as much to do with reflecting how music exists online ? everything immediately available, stripped of its historical context ? as with showing off the contents of the band?s record collection. There?s something breathless about how it leaps from Drake-esque Auto-Tune to the smoky west coast jazz of Mine, to Love It If We Made It, (which sounds like Tears for Fears circa Songs from the Big Chair) to Give Yourself a Try?s knowing homage to Joy Division?s Disorder.
The album has more to offer than a series of clever pastiches. The band?s inventive songwriting never stints on radio friendliness ? the melody of TooTimeTooTimeTooTime is effervescent, while I Couldn?t Be More in Love is the kind of epic song that TV talent-show contestants feel impelled to take on. But they also push themselves. The vocal on Petrichor floats over stammering, glitchy techno; a quarter of Sincerity Is Scary is taken up with its intro, a cosseting blend of jazzy horns and piano.
On the downside, Healy has a tendency to occasionally tell you things you wish he?d kept to himself. The acoustic ballad Be My Mistake has a lovely melody, but it is also the sound of a rock star complaining about ladies wanting to have sex with him, as curious a play for the listener?s sympathy today as it was ever was. Then again, operating without filter is the point of Matty Healy. The same strange personality evinced in his interviews ? where grandiose rock-star pronouncements vie with painful honesty ? weaves through A Brief Inquiry.
Boldly, the album goes big on a deeply unfashionable, Bono-esque belief in the power of rock, as means of communication and as a unifying force in an atomised world. ?Instead of calling me out you should be pulling me in,? Healy sings. This is not a belief without pitfalls. There are certainly moments where his self-appointed spokesman-for-a-generation role weighs a little heavily and he ends up dealing in windy melodramatics ? ?modernity has failed us!? ? or singing things such as ?rest in peace Lil Peep / the poetry is in the streets?.
That tendency is undercut by Healy?s touching candour. The depiction of his heroin addiction on It?s Not Living (If It?s Not With You) is funny and unsparing, devoid of self-pity, at odds with the beautifully turned 80s pop backing. As a lover, he doesn?t emerge terribly well from Inside Your Mind or Sincerity Is Scary, both unvarnished portraits of jealousy and hypocrisy. He has a habit of completely wrong-footing you. The Siri-voiced The Man Who Married a Robot starts out abysmally ? like a well-meaning but excruciating youth theatre group performance about the perils of the internet ? but it unexpectedly turns witty and sharp. Surrounded By Heads and Bodies is another gorgeous song, delicate and understated, that takes its title from David Foster Wallace?s Infinite Jest. This seems pretentious until you realise it is from the book?s opening line ? the implication being that Healy, like many people, couldn?t face reading the whole thing.
A Brief Inquiry is not the unqualified triumph the 1975 had in mind. It?s stronger and punchier than its predecessor, but has moments where the group overreach. You could argue it?s rather confused, but, as Healy would doubtless point out, it is meant to reflect the times we live in, and they?re pretty confusing. And it is never boring ? it?s too restless and skittish for that, shot through with a very believable personality of its own. For all the reference points and deployment of chart-pop tropes, it couldn?t belong to anyone else.

"
pos,"As the album?s intermission, ?The Man Who Married A Robot / Love Theme? is a poem narrated by Siri (yes, the one that lives in your pocket), a Vonnegut-like allegory about loneliness, data, social media and internet addiction, concerning a man, SnowflakeSmasher86, and his friend, The Internet. ?When the man got sad, his friend had so many clever ways to make him feel better / He would get him cooked animals and show him the people having sex again / And he would always always agree with him,? it goes.
It?s easy to see ?The Man Who Married A Robot? as the album?s ?Fitter, Happier?, and it?s not the only moment in which ?A Brief Inquiry? begs comparison to Radiohead?s 1997 masterpiece ?OK Computer?. That record, also the band?s third, took a gloomy view of modern life when the internet was a luxury few had access to. Two decades later, The 1975?s album, written from the perspective of four digital natives, doesn?t so much condemn the march of technology, information and social media so much as accept it and debate it. It?s a nuanced record for a time when life?s shades of grey are darker and closer in contrast than they may have previously been, and it?s no less powerful as a result.
And from those greys, colour. Electronic flourishes to revel in. Gospel choirs to lift the soul. Every song offers an unexpected treat: the lovely ?Surrounded By Heads And Bodies? skips into a time-shifting drum beat where a chorus would normally sit; ?I Like America & America Likes Me? is Kanye-level in its virtuosic use of autotune; ?Inside Your Mind? blends ?90s post-rock with torch-song balladry and ?I Couldn?t Be More In Love? is a pitch-perfect 1980s wedding song pastiche, one of a handful of numbers that are so wilfully big, bold and emotional you expect upcoming tours may require six encores to bash each of them out with the appropriate gravity. Perhaps the biggest surprise comes in the form of ?Mine?, a Cole Porter-influenced jazz number that evokes golden era Hollywood, Disney soundtracks and finger-clicking crooners while reflecting wryly on modern life (?I fight crime online sometimes / I write rhymes I hide behind,?), a jarring dissonance that feels like hearing a song you?ve known your whole life for the very first time.
?Mine? is a breathtaking piece of work, and one of many here that proves that The 1975?s core songwriting team of Matty Healy and George Daniel are not just the most accomplished and creative duo working in pop right now but the closest thing we have to a present-day Lennon and McCartney, a pair whose golden touch makes them near-enough unassailable. Clever and profound, funny and light, serious and heartbreaking, painfully modern and classic-sounding all at the same time, ?A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships? is a game-changing album, one that challenges The 1975?s peers ? if, indeed, there are any ? to raise their game.

So Healy had set out to describe his own experience, but in doing so has produced an artefact that sums up millennial life, a magpie pop masterpiece that could only be made right now and right here. And for every stupid joke you?ve heard about avocados and house prices and safe spaces and jazz hands, this is a piece of art that shows another side to a generation, one of achievement, wit and humanity in the most confusing of times. Clever boys.
"
pos,"Matty Healy always said the first three 1975 albums would tell a story: his own, from teen dreamer living in an affluent hinterland of Manchester (2013?s self-titled debut) to pop star in the first flushes of fame (2016?s ?I Like It When You Sleep For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It?) and the Ziggy-ish conclusion to come.
Instead, The 1975 took to the studio to produce not one but two albums, the first of which is ?A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relations?, with the second, ?Notes On A Conditional Form?, to come next year. And this third album doesn?t just tell the story of Matty?s maturation as promised, it touches on modern politics, our relationship with technology and the entire Millennial experience, too. In doing so, it alights on bubblegum pop (?TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME?), glitchy electronica (?How To Draw / Petrichor?), balladry (?Be My Mistake?), neo-jazz (?Sincerity Is Scary?), trad jazz (?Mine?) and all points in between.

If this is the continuing story of Matty Healy, things have either been going right on course or falling apart, depending on your preferred flavour of rock star. This is the album on which Matty?s self-destructive tendencies have taken hold, the cocaine psychosis of 2016?s ?UGH!? swapped for the rock clich‚s of heroin addiction, rehab, therapy, windswept solitude in a Northants residential studio and sun-drenched isolation in LA.
It?s a rich run of life experience that informs the album in surprising ways, not least ?It?s Not Living (If It?s Not With You)?, a ?Pretty In Pink?-style power-pop banger that sings dreamily about heroin as if it were a great lost love (?All I do is sit and think about you / If I knew what you?d do / Collapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes / It?s not living if it?s not with you?). It?s funny, clever and refreshingly honest, and it?s not even the most confessional thing here ? that would be a toss-up between ?Be My Mistake?, a heart-wrenching, guilt-sodden song about on-tour loneliness and infidelity, or ?I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)?, the massive closing track, which is so personal and intense it might just leave you in tears.
So on the one hand it is a personal album about Matty?s experience, but it?s also an album about love in all its forms (even for delicious opiates), love being the thread that links its genre-hopping tracks. And there?s a macro scale to the album, too, one that holds a mirror up to society as well as to Matty?s pretty fizog. The towering ?Love It If We Made It? stands and points, aghast, at real-world horrors that have somehow been normalised, most jarringly ?a beach of drowning three-year-olds? and the words of the President Of The United States Of America, repeated verbatim, ?I moved on her like a bitch?, casting no particular opinion and asking the listener to draw conclusions instead.

"
pos,"Since storming out of the gates with their first EP six years ago, UK act the 1975 has thrown themselves into the sort of ?biggest band in the world? chatter that defines the music press of their homeland. Their penchant for huge choruses and hyper-neurotic lyrics made tracks like ?Chocolate? and ?Love Me? leap out of radios; leader Matty Healy possesses the wiry energy of rock?s most beloved vocalists and the thinking-out-loud candor of the post-Livejournal generation.
But calling them a rock band would be a fool?s errand, and their third record, the spectacular, genre-melding A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, proves that even further. A sprawling, thoughtful LP that grapples with the big issues of our time in cheeky and mournful ways, it?s a poison-pen love letter to the interiority forced upon its audience by social media, piercing through the flatly punctuation-mark-free affect that dominates online chatter with brute-force musical curiosity and a well-placed gospel choir or two.

The scream-along ?Love It If We Made It,? which repurposes nihilistic trending topics into hope for bonhomie amidst soul-deadening anomie, and the percolating ?Give Yourself A Try,? a note to Healy?s younger self that speeds up and refracts The Strokes? ?Hard to Explain,? fall somewhere in the jittery, riff-heavy modern-rock ideal. But much of Inquiry takes on the trend of dourness that?s washed over pop these past few years and flips it into explorations of the self, propelled by a streaming-era knack for zig-zag-ing through genres in seconds?sophistipop fades into jazz fades into big-ticket MOR fades into Quiet Storm. Call it a brief inquiry into the state of the all-ballad playlist: ?Surrounded By Heads and Bodies,? which places its spare poem about a rehab friend of Healy?s beneath a winking Infinite Jest reference, is a haze of bedroom-studio guitars and swirling synths; the pleading ?I Couldn?t Be More In Love? glistens like a single tear falling down a cheek, Healy?s anguished vocal joining forces with a gospel choir over icy keyboards; and ?Mine? mashes together brushed drums, static electricity, a solo by the late jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove, and Healy?s crushed-velvet delivery.
?Sincerity Is Scary,? proclaims the title of one Inquiry standout among many, a shuffling rumination on the gaps between people that underscores Healy?s hoped-for leap into faith with a gospel choir. But on this stunning album, The 1975 take on that overwhelming anxiety with nerve and aplomb, and the result combines the fist-raising inspired by anthems with the gut-punch provided by precisely described longing.
"
pos,"The 1975 have been playing together since they were schoolboys in Cheshire in 2002, releasing a thrilling debut album in 2013 and developing in leaps and bounds ever since. What they have done, perhaps better than anyone else, is to adapt the swaggering gang manner, art-school aspirations and rebellious conviction of a classic rock combo for the shiny, instant-gratification impulses of our digital pop era. It's a fusion that - in a time when rock is routinely dismissed as dead - might just prove to be the genre's greatest hope.
As its arch title implies, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships is vigorously engaged with contemporary culture, and the band have concocted a sound to match. The ambience is overloaded, kaleidoscopic, a dizzying rush of styles mashed together, encompassing vocoder folk (The 1975), glitchy electronica (How To Draw / Petrichor), cocktail jazz (Mine), sensitive acoustic singer-songwriting (Be My Mistake), warped neo soul (Sincerity Is Scary), lush synth balladry (I Couldn't Be More In Love), fizzing indie rock (Give Yourself A Try) and sugar-coated dance pop (TOOTIMETOOTIME-TOOTIME). It could almost be a random playlist on shuffle but for the unifying aesthetic factors of lyrical, vocal and instrumental tone.
Lead singer Matt Healy is a clever lyricist, easily shifting from witty sloganeering to tender confessional while squeezing phrases like ""self-referential"" and ""intermediately versed"" into love songs bristling with chart pop hooks. A theme emerges of trust in the internet age, shot through with anxiety about whether honest interpersonal communication can survive a relentless assault of information. A spoken word piece, The Man Who Married a Robot, is expressionlessly narrated by Apple's virtual assistant Siri. It labours a satirical point about our willingness to sacrifice human connection for virtual gratification, but it is still affecting, turning ""You can go on his Facebook"" into a bleak epitaph.
A tone of urgent honesty pulses through the album, a visceral need to connect that shatters the production's glittering surfaces, breaking through with emotional weight on the warped synth ballad Inside Your Mind and the dreamily epic final track, I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes).
""There are no big bands doing anything as interesting as us,"" Healy, 29, recently proclaimed. It is the kind of rubbish rock stars used to spout all the time, and yet it is oddly reassuring to hear a young, 21st-century frontman in the ring with that old-fashioned bravado, inviting all-comers to take pot shots. Right now, The 1975 are the band to beat.

"
pos,"As well as having a mouthful of a title, the 1975's sophomore album, 2016's I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, is the kind of ambitious, self-indulgent album that either marks a grand misstep by a fledgling band, or the start of something big. Produced by Mike Crossey, I Like It When You Sleep finds the 1975 picking up on many of the stylistic threads running through their Crossey-helmed, self-titled 2013 debut: synthy new wave, kinetic dance-rock, and atmospheric balladry. The difference this time around is Crossey, and the band's pristine studio execution, marked by a distinctive '80s adult contemporary aesthetic. While bands like MGMT and Vampire Weekend have long mined the VH-1 vaults for stylistic inspiration, there's nothing mannered about the 1975's retro-leanings. Despite their name and their ear for '80s synthesizers, the British outfit sound much more flamboyant than their contemporaries. This is primarily due to the contributions of lead singer Matthew Healy, whose overly wordy lyrics and weird, playfully dark persona -- sort of like a sexual Fraggle -- can sometimes put listeners off the pop scent. As he sings on ""The Sound,"" ""It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me/A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic, junkie wannabe.""
In that sense, the 1975 are more in line with the swagger of artists like INXS, U2, or even Madonna for that matter, whose early hits clearly had an impact on the group's approach here. Cuts like ""UGH!,"" and the cheeky, plastic funk single ""Love Me,"" sound delightfully like something Madonna might have made in collaboration with Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers and art-pop duo Yello. Similarly, ""The Sound"" and the sparkling anthem ""She's American,"" feature brightly infectious hooks that wouldn't be out of place on a Prince album. In fact, there's a palpable R&B inclination running through much of I Like It When You Sleep. It's a vibe that reaches an apex on the yearning, mid-album slow-jam, ""If I Believe You,"" which also happens to feature a gorgeously rendered flÅgelhorn solo from jazz star and longtime D'Angelocollaborator Roy Hargrove.
Elsewhere, in keeping with the overall '80s adult contemporary sound, tracks like the shimmeringly moody ""Somebody Else"" and the sweetly romantic ""Paris,"" bring to mind Tango in the Night-era Fleetwood Mac. Admittedly, at 17 tracks, I Like It When You Sleep is long. And given the poetic, atmospheric nature of many of the songs, it's somewhat unwieldy in one sitting. Ultimately, however, it's that uncompromising mix of POP (in capitalize letters) and inventive, exploratory musicianship that help make it such a rewarding listen. As the title implies, it may take the 1975 a while to get to the point on I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, but when they do, the results are revelatory.

"
pos,"The 1975?s second album arrives freighted with expectations, and not just the usual expectations that get heaped upon the follow-up to a platinum-selling debut: advance publicity suggests that listeners should prepare for something strange, confounding and experimental. Some of this has been emanating from what?s left of the music press: ?hugely ambitious and surreal?, ?no easy listen?, ?2016?s most unpredictable album?. And some of it has come from the 1975?s frontman, Matty Healy, a man who happily seems to have made it his life?s mission to never knowingly think before speaking when in the presence of a journalist: ?I?m challenging people to sit through an hour and 15 minutes and 17 songs that all sound completely different from each other. It?s quite an emotional investment. It?s art ? the world needs this album.?
To this, one might reasonably respond that the 1975 were a fairly confounding prospect in the first place, a putatively alternative rock band ? leather jackets; two guitars, bass and drums; emo-ish lyrics ? whose music seemed, to the untrained ear, almost identical to the kind of chart pop that alternative rock bands are supposed to provide an alternative to: their eponymous debut was thick with synthesisers and the kind of 80s drivetime-rock influences that underpin Taylor Swift?s 1989 or Carly Rae Jepsen?s Emotion, and for all the surly posturing in photographs, there?s a doe-eyed, boyband-ish quality about Healy?s vocals. Still, even the most cursory examination of I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It reveals that someone has contracted a raging case of the Serious Artists, a condition developed by pop stars who discover that selling hundreds of thousands of records and attracting crowds of screaming girls leaves them curiously unfulfilled.
All the common indications are here, from the self-consciously wordy title to the presence of a sombre instrumental that skulks around for four and a half minutes hoping someone?s going to compare it to Brian Eno or Berlin-era Bowie. Elsewhere we find singles heralded by typewritten manifestos and illustrations based on old Situationist cartoons; a desire to induce people to deploy the adjective ?meta? ? the album begins with another version of the brief eponymous track that opened their debut, as if it were a theme tune or advertising jingle, and there are a lot of lyrics that seem to address their fanbase?s fandom ? and the presence of arcing, distorted guitars in the style of My Bloody Valentine or Mogwai.
Further complications arise from the fact that they appear to be suffering from Second Album Syndrome, too, presenting symptoms including the delusional belief that your cocaine habit is fascinating, a pathological urge to furnish a grateful world with the news that fame isn?t all it?s cracked up to be, and a compulsion to apprise everyone of the hollowness and insincerity of celebrity parties. This is pretty well-worn territory, and occasionally it feels like it ? introduced by an eerie female chorus and heavy on screamed vocals, The Ballad of Me and My Brain is a faintly excruciating depiction of rockstar ennui.
Incredibly, though, most of the time Healy gets away with it. That?s sometimes because his observations are sharp ? as a skewering of celebrity #squad culture, ?you look famous, let?s be friends / And portray we possess something important / And do the things we like? is pretty acute ? but more usually because they come loaded with witty self-awareness and deprecation: the endless depictions of vacuous, coke-numbed girls he has met would get wearying were it not for the fact that he keeps turning the lyrical crosshair on himself. The lady in A Change of Heart sounds awful, but not as awful as him, quoting Jack Kerouac ?like a twat?. Furthermore, he has an eye for a prosaic detail that undercuts the air of bustling self-importance. Rock stars have a tendency to depict their drug problems in hysterically grandiose terms ? ?what tongueless ghost of sin crept through my curtains?? as Noel Gallagher put it ? but Healy is more mundane and realistic: ?You look shit and you smell a bit.?
Advertisement
Besides, for all the talk about the hollowness of celebrity, I Like It When You Sleep ? does not sound much like the work of people in any great hurry to leave fame behind. The stuff about Situationism feels a bit hackneyed and bolted on: the album ends with stark and affecting acoustic tracks about the death of Healy?s grandmother and his mother?s collapse into postnatal depression ? the former called Nana, no less ? that suggest the frontman may be substantially more interested in painful soul-bearing than in arch commentary. The musical experimentation, meanwhile, is neither here nor there: you could find better moody instrumentals and shoegazey guitar tracks elsewhere, and it perhaps says more about the times than the album in question when a rock band drafting in a gospel choir (on If I Believe You) gets treated as a baffling musical left-turn from which the blown minds of listeners may never fully recover. Instead, the real strength of the album isn?t much different to that of their debut. It?s stuffed with really good pop songs, their writers clearly unencumbered by fear of a certain melodic gaucheness: certainly there are few songs about numb-nosed ennui with quite as shamelessly toothsome a tune as Paris. Subtlety and fine detail are left for the arrangements, or at least some of them: there?s real intricacy in the mesh of guitars and synthesisers on UGH! or Love Me, and a knowingness about the way This Must Be My Dream breaks out the Careless Whisper sax three minutes in, but The Sound is straightforward pop-house. The real point of these songs is the huge, inescapable pop hook you find in all of them: they sound like hit singles.
You?re left with an album that fancies itself as a challenging work of art, but turns out to be a collection of fantastic pop songs full of interesting, smart lyrics, but also peppered with self-conscious lunges for a gravitas it doesn?t really need. Whether that makes it a success or a failure depends on whose metric you use, although there?s a sense that, for all his grandstanding, Healy may know where his strengths really lie: ?I?m the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques,? he shrugs on Loving Someone, immediately after making a clanging reference to Guy Debord. He can afford his insouciance: its failings aren?t going to preclude I Like It When You Sleep ? becoming a vast success.

"
pos,"Hey, what gives, fellas? INXS and Duran Duran weren?t around in 1975. This ascendant U.K. quartet ground their second album in sleek dance rock that often feels like it was sculpted on a gaudy Eighties budget as the bandmates tried hard not to get too sweaty in their aqua-neon sport jackets. No shame in that ? and they do it well, filtering in elements of spacy ambience (with echoes of acts from My Bloody Valentine to M83), Jacksonian R&B and arty dance pop. At times, the vibe approximates what might have happened if Michael Hutchence had stuck around long enough to make a record with LCD Soundsystem?s James Murphy in the producer?s chair. ?Love Me? funkily recalls Nile Rodgers? splashiest Duran productions; ?A Change of Heart? is the John Hughes soundtrack ballad moment. Singer Matthew Healy is a smooth, versatile crooner, going from disco lizard king (the slickly strutting ?UGH?) to the Brit-soul buoyancy of ?Loving Someone? to the careless whispers of ?Paris.?
The album?s rambling, vaguely emo title is a giveaway: Despite opening big, bright and airtight, I Like It When You Sleep ? gets boring-melty during dream-gaze reveries like ?Please Be Naked? and ?Lostmyhead.? Even so, when they hit the right kind of moody sheen (?Somebody Else,? ?Loving Someone?), the 1975 are an enjoyable balance of desire and distraction.
"
pos,"The 2013 self-titled debut album from the 1975 is a superb album that finds the Manchester outfit poised on the brink of stardom. When rock guitars meet dancefloor synths, '80s influences become hard to deny, but while the 1975 definitely have a retro vibe (hence the name), the alchemy of how they bring those influences to bear is totally contemporary. While many of the tracks here bring to mind such icons as Peter Gabriel, INXS, and U2, they also fit nicely next to artists of the same moment, like Passion Pit, Temper Trap, and M83. It helps that lead singer/songwriter Matthew Healy has a compelling tenor croon that can soar like Bono one minute and coo like Lionel Richie the next. There is also a sophistication to the band's songs, and an instinct to blur genre lines that makes it hard to box them into one, easy to define sound. In that sense, the band also recalls the way Fall Out Boy combined the rhythmic phrasing and melodies of contemporary R&B with their own brand of driving, guitar-based emo-rock. Much has been made of the 1975's avowed love of '80s John Hughes movies, and many of the cuts here, like the thrilling, lovesick ""Settle Down"" and the sparkling ""Girls,"" play with such great narrative momentum that they sound like songs culled from a Hughes soundtrack. Meanwhile, cuts like ""The City,"" ""Chocolate,"" and ""Sex"" drive and climb like the best anthemic '80s stadium rock, roiling a host of influences into a single distinct sound that, the moment it hits your ears, becomes timeless.

"
pos,"The debut album by this Manchester, U.K.-based quartet follows a series of EPs and includes re-recorded versions of several tracks (?The City,? ?Sex,? ?Chocolate?). Their sound is hard to pin down; while it?s primarily built around guitars, bass and drums, there are synths underpinning nearly every song, and the rhythms have a bounce lifted from urban pop??Chocolate? has an almost boy-band buoyancy, making it an ideal summer single. Their major-key melodies and ?80s guitar sounds avoid the moody post-punk dress-up games played by too many current bands, recalling instead new wave-era outfits like General Public, Fun Boy Three and Wang Chung. ?Robbers? could have fit right in on the soundtrack to a John Hughes teen-angst movie, and they?re successfully anthemic on ?She Way Out,? like a nerdy, English version of the Gaslight Anthem. But when they try on modern, digitally glitchy production on ?Menswear,? by contrast, it feels (ironically, given the track?s title) like they?re struggling in ill-fitting clothes."
pos,"A few years back, an extraordinary proposition by the name of Palladium was set before the British public. Or, rather, it was flashed ever so briefly in front of them before it was decided this was a proposition in which the public had no interest. Palladium's debut album, despite being sent out to the media repeatedly, backed by a press campaign that verged on the hysterical, was never actually released, and Palladium ceased to be. They were an odd affair, seemingly transported from the mid-80s, the kind of band who wouldn't make much sense unless their videos were filmed on yachts, with the members wearing silk jackets with the sleeves not rolled but pushed up their arms; you could imagine them on the Swap Shop sofa telling Noel Edmonds they wanted to sound like both Chic and the Sex Pistols. They had some memorable songs and some sharp lyrics, but it was hard to avoid the suspicion that they were to Duran Duran what the Darkness were to Judas Priest: a fond and elaborate practical joke. They looked as if they should have been appearing in a nightclub scene in Dynasty rather than cropping up on Molly Ringwald's turntable in a John Hughes movie.
The 1975 look to roughly the same period on their debut album, and also offer up some memorable songs with some sharp lyrics. You can even imagine them saying they want to embrace both the Sex Pistols and Chic. At times, their debut is so precisely calibrated to 1983 that you can all but hear Tommy Vance's voice: ""This is the Radio 1 official top 40 ? and that was the 1975, tasting good in that all-important No 15 slot with Chocolate ?"" So why is their debut expected to go high in the charts, with sellout shows in big venues to come, while Palladium's didn't even get released?
""We're massive fans of John Hughes,"" singer Matt Healy has said. ""We wanted to make a record [that] was almost a soundtrack to our teenage years. If he made a movie about us, this would be the soundtrack."" If no one watches Dynasty anymore, except perhaps in chance encounters at the outer edge of the Sky Plus planner, then the legacy of Hughes's ensemble movies about teenage and young adult life lives on, as was evident in the responses to his death in 2009. Brat Pack movie archetypes ? wry girls on drugs, lotharios lying to themselves, guys trying to up the sexual ante ? inhabit Healy's lyrics, which at their best are closely observed and tart, without ever tipping over into cynicism for the sake of it ? much like Hughes's better films.
There's quite a lot of sex and quite a lot of drugs here, but when Healy gets it right, he captures the cadences of people who are slightly wearied by the pressure to have A Good Time, lest real life catch up, like the lad in Sex, who's wondering if there's any point getting a blowjob from a girl who already has a boyfriend: ""And I'm not trying to stop you love/ But if we're going to do anything we might as well just fuck."" Better still is Menswear, with the pissed-and-pilled protagonist surveying the guests at a wedding ? ""He looks just like me, but he's six foot three, so I reckon you could knock him out"" ? and telling the groom what he thinks of his bride, set on top of a weirdly wobbling instrumental arrangement that sounds cheerfully drunk. Those lyrics look a bit sub-Alex Turner quoted so baldly, but the best of the writing here ? and it works better at length ? is fabulous.
The four EPs the 1975 have released over the past year have made the case that they fancy themselves as artists, not just pop singers, with ambient interludes and their careful self-presentation in monochrome. There are ambient interludes here, too ? the title track, An Encounter, 12 ? but they're just dots of flavour: the emphasis is on pop. There have been labradors less bouncy and excitable than Girls; Heart Out continues Noah and the Whale's recent revival of four-to-the-floor drivetime pop rock, albeit with compaints about ""your obsession with rocks and brown/ and fucking the whole town"". It doesn't always work: Robbers is a power ballad so bland that the mention of a gun in the first verse has one pleading for Chekhov's maxim to be ignored: don't wait for the third act to use it, pull the trigger now and let's pretend the whole song never happened. It's a salutary reminder that if you time travel back to the 80s, you risk returning with Mr Mister and Cutting Crew spliced into your DNA.
What first appears to be a weakness for the 1975 might turn out to be a strength. You wouldn't call theirs the most distinctive of sounds: you can point to almost all the elements of most any song here and tell where it came from. If that suggests there's still some musical character to be formed, it also means there's space to form it: they haven't got the curse of the sui generis band, condemned always to churn out decreasingly exciting simulacrums of their original statement. For the 1975, what comes next might be even better.

"
pos,"The 1975 have made much of their eclecticism, the way that YouTube has effectively telescoped all of pop history into one big stylistic marketplace. Which raises the obvious question: then why settle on a sound like this ? a blend of electropop and slick guitar work, which suggests that they should have called themselves The 1985. With their lyrical focus on teen sex, money and the misplaced glamour of crime, at times it's like ?Girls Just Wanna Have Fun?, for boys. Which is fine as far as it goes: ?Tell me what you need at 17,? sings Matthew Healy, ?Just girls, breaking hearts?. But the infectious pop thrill that attends the singles ?The City?, ?Sex? and ?Chocolate? soon tarnishes through the sort of repetition that suggests their eclecticism isn't quite as broad as they imagine."
neg,"The 1975 could use some enunciation lessons and an editor: Their debut, a Top 40 hit in America, is a long, often inscrutable set that rifles through synth-rock references like Neon Trees doing a poor M83 impression. Their would-be smash, ""Sex,"" isÿLCD Soundsystem'sÿ""All My Friends"" viaÿthe Killers'ÿ""Somebody Told Me,"" but the LP mostly forces unconvincing emo lyrics into a bloopy 1980s package."
pos,"No one has captured the 80's since the 80's like the 1975. Tight grooves, big hooks, synth flourishes, and spanky guitar adorned with angsty, coming of age lyrics delivered by an actual fledgling rock star. But it's no throwback - every note, every beat sounds modern and fresh. The production is exquisite, glossy at times yes, but the overall vibe is intoxicating, with huge tracks like ""Chocolate"" ""Sex"" ""The City"" ""Robbers"" ""Pressure"" and ""Girls."" Perhaps not as instantly likable, other tracks such as ""Settle Down"" ""Heart Out"" and ""Talk!"" grow to be infectious. The 1975's world is a world you want to live in. They've brought back the high art of making music that we saw in the 1980's. Back in 2013 I thought this was the best album of year. I stand by that still heading into 2018. A stunning debut."
pos,The 1975's debut album is a bleak and honest work of art that will reach out to its demographic in a very unique way.
pos,"A good album in the ""12 3 minute pop songs"" genre, although there are 16 tracks. Lots of upbeat stuff like ""Chocolate"", ""M.O.N.E.Y."" and ""Settle Down"". A couple of short tracks are a bit pointless but it's well worth a listen."
pos,"Somewhat a combination of their earliest work and that of their EP releases, the 1975's debut LP is a great pop/rock record that can really deliver to a widespread audience.
With engaging guitar-lick hooks on tracks like ""Settle Down"" and ""Chocolate,"" pop-punk style bangers like ""Sex,"" and synthed-up vocals and bass synth cuts like ""Menswear,"" there's really something for almost everyone here. Much more sophisticated than they may lead off, the 1975's musicianship, lyrics, and Crossey's production tecnique, make for a unique and sincere record album."
pos,"Punchy, catchy, unique. The 1975 put an emphasis on groove, much akin to the likes of Maroon 5, but with a little John Mayer guitar flair and 80s synth pop to put a little gloss on top of it all. ""Chocolate"", ""Girls"", ""Robbers"" round out my favorites."
pos,"This band surprised me, not a big fan of this genre of music, however this record has it all. The new record by The 1975 has huge bombastic beats great catchy vocals and should go down as one of the best albums of the year."
pos,"The 1975's followup is a bit long, but brilliantly produced, with more of the impeccable mixing, immersive soundscapes, visceral tones, and wordy yet wonderfully written lyrics that the band has to offer."
pos,"This album was hard to pin down into any genre for me. First off, let me say that I do not like the lead single 'Love Me"". I think it's a horrible song. That being said, it's also the worst song on this album, so getting past it and finding some good tracks on here was quite a pleasant surprise for me. I enjoyed the ambient interludes and I thought the album was at it's strongest when Healy and the band slowed things down. 

I came into this album having only ever heard the band's hit singles, like ""Chocolate"" and 'Sex"". I walked away from this album with a little more respect for the group.

"
pos,"While I do feel that I like it When You Sleep... is a weaker album than the self titled debut it still has it?s moments and is very enjoyable in places. While there is nothing as lyrically passionate as Sex or any riffs and gorgeous as the one of Robbers, there are still some great songs on here. The Sound and Paris are rally catchy and passionately sung by Healy. I personally adore the 80?s influences. Somebody Else is another really moving song. In particular I like the 80?s Roxy Music vibe this album has.

Unfortunately the bad songs do outnumber the good. Songs such as Love Me, where the riff on is a rip off, off Let?s Dance by David Bowie and the last song, the religious themed If I Believe in You and the acoustic She Lays down just don?t work. Like with the debut, the instrumental, filler songs are completely forgettable and add nothing to the overall listen and lyrically the album is immature in places. Lost my head in particular is incredibly irritating with its spoken vocals and dragged out synth tone. To conclude I like it When You Sleep has some gems but is a frustrating listen as at 73 minutes it?s too long and self-indulged. "
pos,"The 1975 are all over the map when it comes to style. They're stuck somewhere between Maroon 5, Michael Jackson, and INXS. Their punchy & funky pop/rock can strike some excellent cords, evidenced by the superb ""UGH"" and ""The Sound"". This band may have put out a few too many tracks (which devoted fans won't mind) but with so much selection comes ample opportunity to pick and pull your favorites and still come away with a decent amount to listen to. My biggest complaint is that the band doesn't seem to keep things faster in pace throughout the album, often giving way to slower ballads when the band is clearly at their best when things are punchier and faster (see ""Love Me"" and ""She's American""). Some of the slower numbers to eventually catch on (""If I Believe You"", ""Loving Someone"") but much of the rest are perhaps left alone or as background ""mood"" music - some of the content on I Like It When You Sleep cater to that purpose rather well.

I like what's going on here, I just think The 1975 need to focus their efforts a bit more, find more up-tempo numbers to throw onto a disc and use the slower stuff as momentum shifters - keeping the album fresh throughout. These guys are clearly gifted at setting a groove."
neg,"As others have said, it's hard to pinpoint the genre of this album. Whilst, the use of various genres might have worked for Beyonce on her latest effort, these varying tracks do not work together in creating an effective album. 

This album might contain some interesting tracks, but they are few and far between. For an album over 70 minutes in length, you'd hope to it to be more engaging.

'The Sound' - The band's most played track on Spotify, has too much going on, that doesn't fit together for it to be remotely listenable.

The band did deliver, however, with tracks like 'Love Me' and 'She's American'. 'Love Me' is extremely self aware, and gave us a catchy, INXS-like, riff.

The 1975 could have cut the majority of this album and created a very effective EP."
pos,"As far as sophomore efforts go, this is pretty impressive. Dealing with the disillusionment of fame, love and being out of place in the big city, its carries a substantial amount of weight. They've also been allowed to experiment and express themselves on an ambient level, adding layers of atmosphere to virtually every song. There are brief moments of the playfulness (even childishness) of their debut effort, but that only detracts slightly from what is otherwise a fantastic offering. 
"
pos,"This album is well produced, and has a lot of good songs--but nothing particularly great. The depth, uniqueness, and purpose of its predecessors is missing from this one, but fans will find plenty to enjoy."
pos,"This is not just a record, it's a political statement and a slice of history from a time when punk was about changing the status quo, and not the fashion it eventually became. There are the more notable numbers here of course (""Anarchy..."" ""God Save the Queen""), but the ones that aren't quite so well known are more than worthy of your attention. ""Bodies"" for example, just screams at you, and who would have thought about rhyming ""Birmingham"" with ""abortion"" if not for Johnny Rotten (Lyndon). I recall an interview in which he stated that the song came to him after a visit from ""Polly"" herself, who held out a plastic bag with a fetus in it. True or not, it's a strange circumstance to evolve into a song. ""I'm not an animal"" indeed."
pos,"I absolutely love this album, I even saw the Pistols when they did the reunion tour in early 2000 In Manchester and Rotten as not lost none of his bite and his humour as me in stiches, such as shame they never got the chance to record another album as classic as this is."
pos,"love this record? Read Lydon's fascinating ANGER IS AN ENERGY and you'll love it all over again- and probably understand how useful and creative anger can be and understand yet even better than ever what the record is really all about. 

A unique, timeless, classic, essential 38:45 minutes of fantastic energy."
pos,"Best punk album of the 70's. Better than their contemporanies. Great,great album"
pos,"While the rage expressed on the greatest punk album of all time (yep, there it is) has lost some of it's bite today - mainly due to the fact that most of the people associated in it's creation are too old or too dead to do anything about it now - it's not hard to see why the Pistols might have scared people back in '77: Anger is a powerful thing, especially in the hands of young men talented and willing enough to express it so bluntly and brutally. 'I am an antichrist!' Rotten snarls on 'Anarchy in the UK'. You may not believe it, but it's clear that he does."
pos,"The Clash might have a valid claim to best encapsulating punk rock?s radical political ethos, The Damned can rightly claim the first real UK punk record with their debut single New Rose, The Ramones were 1-2-3-4?ing across the pond on their debut album a good 18 months before this album and Iggy Pop could legitimately claim the crown of ?godfather of punk?, but it is the Sex Pistols (and the songs here) that, for me, defined the short-lived phenomenon that was badged punk rock. Intriguingly, with the obvious heavier rock influences (most notably The Stooges), the musical style and songs here ? music driven largely by erstwhile bassist Glen Matlock, lyrics by John Lydon ? really do not fit with the ?1-2-3-4 style? often associated with the punk genre. What is certain, however, is that the sonic power of this band (realised here by producer Chris Thomas) and the immediacy and urgency of the songs have diminished not one jot since 1977.

There are probably no two songs that evoke the spirit and ethos of 1970s UK punk rock more vividly than Anarchy In The UK and God Save The Queen ? arguably, not since the advent of Elvis Presley?s thrusting hips had music experienced such a (seemingly) anarchic and threatening presence to the status quo (no, not the band!). Then, John and co. also gave us one of rock?s greatest ever song openings (and, of course, videos) on Pretty Vacant, but there really is not a duff song here, from the more commercial feel of the likes of No Feelings and EMI (which concerned the band?s fractious relationship with the record label) through to the Stooges-like intensity of Bodies and Submission. In many ways, I suspect we should be thankful that this band only really had it in them to make a single album, but what an album it was (and we should probably thank our lucky stars that Richard Hell didn?t get any closer to being Malcolm McLaren?s chosen front man)!"
pos,"A masterpiece. A Magnum Opus. A Album To Influence Several Albums to Come. Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols is one of the greatest album ever. Rotten's vocals on Anarchy In The U.K, Bodies, God Save The Queen and all the songs are a major threat to music at the time creating a huge impact on several grounds. The opening will get you excited with that foot stomping Holidays In The Sun. By the end, you'll see why Punk is not dead today, because we have this album to prove it after all these years. Whether it's straight up your ass hard or catchy pop hooks fused with punk, The Sex Pistols changed everything. They couldn't have made another album, it would have just contradicted what they had to say. Everyone needs to listen to this outstanding album, your life will change after that I guarantee it.
"
pos,"""Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols"" is the only studio album Sex Pistols ever released, the rest of the releases were just record company releasing compilation and that kind of stuff to get more money with the band. One album is enough to change the music. For example, the thrash metal band Megadeth has made a cover of two songs of this album. ""Anarchy in the U.K."" and ""Problems"". Megadeth showed anarchy to perform the songs using their way. The original versions are better IMO - then we may remember Mot”rhead recorded ""God Save the Queen"". The style was so raw, they were not as polished as Ramones - Sex Pistols was angry about the injustice in the world and the elitists ruling the poor people and driving with the luxury cars. ""Holidays in the Sun"" is a fantastic opener. Then we get ""Bodies"" which is about abortion. It was a shocking song durings its time and it is still. It tells how disgusting is the entire process. Perhaps my favorite song of the album. ""No Feelings"" is another highlight for me. The vocals are maybe the best here. There is lots of energy always - but this song especially. ""Pretty Vacant"" is one of my favorites too.

The album is just rocking with amazing amount of raw power from the first song till the last minute. The best punk rock album of all-time."
pos,Every song on this album is great! Best Punk album of the 70's.
pos,"This is the 22nd album of a thread of album reviews in which I'd like to guide you through my personal musical history based on my top100 Album list you can find in my profile: the previous album in the thread was ""Rattus Norvegicus"" by The Stranglers.

Although this is a punk album, I think this is one of the best rock albums ever. It overflows with energy and also the general song writing is really good. Maybe they were an unruly bunch (especially Sid Vicious: listen to his very peculiar version of ""My Way"") but they did sound fantastic as a band not in the least because of the voice of Johnny Lydon.

"
pos,"The Clash's debut was such a landmark album that today it sounds inevitable though at the time it was revolutionary. Comparing ""The Clash"" with ""Never Mind the Bullocks"" is much the same as arguing over the relative merits of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In my view, the Sex Pistols may have better captured the sneer of the moment while the Clash achieved something more timeless and transcendent. The riffs and hooks on songs like ""London's Burning"" and ""I'm So Bored with the U.S.A."" resonate with me to this day, which is more than I can say for most of the Pistols' material, groundbreaking as it was. And while most of the tracks on ""The Clash"" are loud and fast in the style that would eventually be sanctified as punk orthodoxy, the crowning achievement on this record was their 6-minute cover of Junior Murvin's ""Police and Thieves."" It's a brilliant reworking of a reggae classic and gave the world its first indication this band would push the boundaries not only their own narrow genre, but of rock and roll itself."
pos,"One of the enduring myths about punk rock is that its artists were rarely proficient or capable of playing their instruments, or that the arrangements were overly simplistic and lacking in depth. The Clash's incendiary eponymous debut proves this false, with Mick Jones' and Strummer's invigorating dual guitar attack, complex arrangements, experimentation with different genres, and an excellent rhythm section courtesy of Paul Simonon, Terry Chimes and Topper Headon. This album marked a quantum leap forward for the genre that can generally be described as ""punk,"" much like Never Mind the Bollocks of the previous year. This album takes the same white-hot rage and surging up-tempo numbers but adds more depth in terms of adding elements such as reggae and increasing the amount of social commentary. Not only was it anti-establishment, it actually offered a viable alternative, a positive message for the youth of England and the world, with its steadfast socialist message. The album conjures images of a decaying urban environment with great effectiveness, and the hopelessness felt by youth facing harsh economic restrictions and sparse employment. By injecting political discourse into the punk movement, bands such as the Clash and the Jam added a resonance to their music which would encourage passionate appreciation throughout the world. In terms of production, the album sounds fairly stripped down and DIY, despite its complexity. Joe Strummer's delivery is hardly beautiful sounding in the narrow, traditional sense, however his utter passion is breathtaking, making him one of the absolute best front men of all time. the Clash's devotion to the subject matter is undeniable (The Clash would not settle to be relegated to the sidelines, they actually got heavily involved with the causes they supported outside the studio and off the stage). This album is a must own for anyone interested in vital, honest, and distinctly modern music."
pos,"the album is a huge triumph, not only influential but one of the greatest punk albums ever recorded. While the Clash would progress beyond the narrow confines of the genre in the future, on their debut they prove their total mastery of the style, paving the way for a multitude of inferior knockoffs. Punk is an inherently limited genre, but the Clash make the most of it, hence this excellent offering."
pos,"Never Mind the Bollocks may have appeared revolutionary, but the Clash's eponymous debut album was pure, unadulterated rage and fury, fueled by passion for both rock & roll and revolution. Though the clich‚ about punk rock was that the bands couldn't play, the key to the Clash is that although they gave that illusion, they really could play ? hard. The charging, relentless rhythms, primitive three-chord rockers, and the poor sound quality give the album a nervy, vital energy. Joe Strummer's slurred wails perfectly compliment the edgy rock, while Mick Jones' clearer singing and charged guitar breaks make his numbers righteously anthemic. Even at this early stage, the Clash were experimenting with reggae, most notably on the Junior Murvin cover ""Police & Thieves"" and the extraordinary ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais,"" which was one of five tracks added to the American edition of The Clash. ""Deny,"" ""Protex Blue,"" ""Cheat,"" and ""48 Hours"" were removed from the British edition and replaced for the U.S. release with the British-only singles ""Complete Control,"" ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais,"" ""Clash City Rockers,"" ""I Fought the Law,"" and ""Jail Guitar Doors,"" all of which were stronger than the items they replaced. Though the sequencing and selection were slightly different, the core of the album remained the same, and each song retained its power individually. Few punk songs expressed anger quite as bracingly as ""White Riot,"" ""I'm So Bored with the U.S.A.,"" ""Career Opportunities,"" and ""London's Burning,"" and their power is all the more incredible today. Rock & roll is rarely as edgy, invigorating, and sonically revolutionary as The Clash."
pos,"""Give 'Em Enough Rope"" is occasionally derided as the Clash's ""classic rock"" album and it's true that producer Sandy Pearlman smoothed out some of the band's rougher edges. Still, there are quite a few classic songs on the record (""Safe European Home"" and ""Tommy Gun"" chief among them), making it absolutely essential listening for even casual fans. ""Rope"" is best described as the sound of The Clash in transition, opening itself up artistically as it evolves from a U.K. punk outfit to ""The Only Band That Matters."""
pos,"It's a pity that some listeners grow so caught up with the tracks' speed that they can't get beyond it, thus missing a truly solid affair that's a worthy follow up to the band's epochal debut. While Give 'Em Enough Rope is admittedly a transitional album, and therefore is neither as good a punk album as the Clash's first effort nor as good a rock record as its successor, it's still a highly strong, compelling sophomore effort, enjoyable on its own terms as well as from a historical perspective as a sign pointing the way to the band's future."
pos,"The Clash's second album is a worthy follow-up to their stunning debut. It's a hard rocking record that contains the same ferocious energy as its predecessor. Unfortunately, this sophomore effort is rarely mentioned as part of the band's legacy. Despite its lack of popularity, ""Rope"" is an essential title in their discography. The standouts tracks are ""Safe European Home"" , ""Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad"" and ""All The Young Punks""."
pos,"London Calling was released at a time when the English punk rock scene was in decline, with musicians turning their attention towards post-punk and new wave music. With this album, The Clash too breaks free from the genre?s limitations and solipsism, while retaining the drive and conviction of a punk rock band. In London Calling, The Clash master reggae and rockabilly as effortlessly as they craft polyvalent pop and R&B songs. Producer Guy Stevens is to thank for the band?s newfound crisp sound, far removed from the hard rock edge of Give ?Em Enough Rope. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones form a solid songwriting team, penning politically charged lyrics about social unrest, racial profiling and drug abuse. With a cover that alludes to Elvis Presley?s influential debut album, yet features Paul Simonon on the verge of smashing his bass guitar, London Calling is a transcendental record that celebrates the romance of rock and roll rebellion. 

The first half of London Calling is flawless and full of dazzling songs. The opening title track is an anthemic rock classic where Strummer?s gritty vocals command an apocalyptic call to arms, backed by ragged guitar licks and Simonon's thundering bassline. Next, The Clash performs a spirited rockabilly cover of Vince Taylor?s ""Brand New Cadillac?, while ?Jimmy Jazz? tells the noire story of an outcast who manages to stay one step ahead of the cops. The catchy ?Hateful"" denounces drug consumption, and ""Rudie Can?t Fail? is a soulful ska salvo that praises the 60's rude boy movement in Jamaica. In ""Spanish Bombs? the band contrasts tragic events of the Spanish Civil War with the country's tourist attractions. ""The Right Profile? is a song about doomed actor Montgomery Clift's car crash and substance abuse. Like ?Lost in the Supermarket?, ?Clampdown? is an energetic and tuneful critique of capitalism. ?The Guns of Brixton? has a stark reggae influence and is written and sung by Simonon, who was brought up in the area. 

The second half of London Calling is slightly less memorable but benefits from the effect of synergy. ?Death of Glory? is a blunt litany of an unworkable ideal, and ""Card Cheat? is a dramatic song dominated by pouncing piano chords and a brass section reminiscent of 60s pop groups. ""Lover?s Rock? and ?I?m Not Down? are further highlights, with Jones using a violin bow to play guitar in the latter. The album closes with ?Train in Vain?, a hidden gem etched in after the sleeve had been printed, which is an addictive and irresistible pop song. The track is sung by Jones and contains a funky guitar riff and a harmonica replicating the sound of a train whistle. As a homage to their roots, the title stems from Robert Johnson?s ?Love in Vain? and the chorus reminds of Ben E. King?s ""Stand by Me"". Though the band's tireless ambition would soon contribute to their downfall, London Calling is a timeless masterpiece of unparalleled originality."
pos,"There is no other album in the world like London Calling. This album could not be better if it tried. It's a mind-blowing experience from beginning to end, starting with the paranoia of the title track, and touching every genre from blues to jazz to ska to reggae before ending on the memorable ""Train in Vain"". What's more incredible about the varied styles, though, is The Clash's ability to pull everything off successfully. ""Rude Can't Fail"" is just as epic as any reggae classic, ""The Right Profile"" is a rockabilly masterpiece with a killer horn section, and ""Lost in the Supermarket"" manages to redefine pop with a punk flavor. This is quite simply one of the greatest albums ever released in the history of music. Although the Clash played pure punk on their early albums, this is the album where they transcended punk and became something new. This is the album where The Clash went from being pioneers to being legends."
pos,"One of all-time best double albums, London Calling is the moment when The Clash transcend the punk movement and become a rock band of the ages. Broadening their scope, the band further explores its love of reggae along with conscious riffing upon the themes found in rockabilly, pop vocals, disco, folk, ska, and R&B, Astonishingly, these disparate influences organically gel into a cohesive musical statement that gets better with each listen.

The title track is an obvious classic, but each track has its own charms. ""Brand New Cadillac"" is a scruffy cover of an overlooked Vince Taylor cut; the original tune is occasionally noted as the first instance of a British musician taking a crack at rock n' roll. ""Train In Vain"" is a relentlessly catchy break-up anthem. ""Death Or Glory"" and ""Clampdown"" are jaded admissions that the group's well-known political diatribes may be somewhat futile. ""Spanish Bombs"" and ""The Guns Of Brixton"" are defiant protests against such assertions.

I could go on about each song on this album, but its myriad pleasures speak for themselves. Anyone with even a casual interest in 20th century rock music should give these recordings a chance; very few will be disappointed."
pos,"I called 'Never Mind the Bollocks' the greatest punk album of all time only because I wouldn't really consider 'London Calling' punk - it's far too bold and musically-diverse to be pigeonholed into such a restrictive category. It's best described as 'apocalypse music', a full-on attack against the establishment. By this description, it may seem strange that it closes with what seems to be a song about unrequited love, until you realize that 'Train in Vain' isn't directed at some flighty tramp who tears your heart out and leaves you alone, but rather to a world that turns it's back on anyone who refuses to conform to the accepted standards of thinking. 'Did you stand by me?; No, not at all!'"
pos,"No exaggeration, this is quite simply one of the great albums of all time! From the hair-raising opener to the famous hidden track, it?s a master class in musical styles and great song writing. On this record The Clash are by turns inspiring, political, social, and fun. They even manage to make the two cover songs their own. Strummer and Jones made a lot of great music, but this was absolutely the height of their powers. My heart starts pumping with excitement just looking at the track list. Do yourself a favor and get this into heavy rotation. By the way, did I mention I really like this record? Essential."
pos,"The Clash?s third album, 1979?s London Calling, is where their brilliance comes together in a 19-track tour de force that uses the energy of their punk origins and employs it in a number of new stylistic directions. Reggae-dub underlines ?Rudie Can?t Fail,? ?Wrong ?Em Boyo,? ?Revolution Rock,? and bassist Paul Simonon?s unnerving ?The Guns of Brixton.? Rockabilly and surf chase the cover of Vince Taylor?s ?Brand New Cadillac.? Genuine pop melodies support the Mick Jones-led ?Spanish Bombs,? ?Lost In the Supermarket,? ?I?m Not Down,? and the hit-single-in-hiding ?Train In Vain? (original copies of the album didn?t list it on the album sleeve). The title track remains one of the most ominous songs ever to kick off any album, never mind a double album of such consequence. And we haven?t even mentioned the brilliance of ?Hateful,? ?Clampdown,? ?Death or Glory? or ?Koka Kola.? Their self-titled debut (in both U.K. and U.S. configurations) stood for punk?s raw power and Sandinista! provided the band with enough room for pure experimentation, but London Calling splits the difference and aims for the center line. Quite simply: a masterpiece by any definition."
pos,"The summit of rock'n'roll. It has only been reached once...twice...Exile on Main St. When I die, I sincerely hope my friends honor me by gathering together and listening to London Calling & Exile on Main St. in their glorious collective entirety. No talking. No bathroom breaks. Just beer, cigarettes and serious vibes. Death & Glory...indeed."
pos,The Only Band That Matters released the album that matters most ? to their legacy and to the decades that followed. Pretty much peerless in consistent inspiration and passion. It's desert island stuff.
pos,"Punk was dead by 1979. It died with Sid Vicious. By this point, Post-Punk had risen from the ashes and Joy Division had released their debut. The Clash were one of the drivinf forces of the Punk Scene, and now with the hype wearing off, They took to the studio and ended up cutting a double record, commonly recognized as one of the greatest LP's of all time. London Calling is a roulette of genres. Punk (Obviously), Rock N Roll, Reggae, New Wave and so much more inbetween. Everything here is a classic. The thundering bass lead opener 'London Calling' is an apocalyptic rocker, 'Revolution Rock' delves more into a reggae style and the hidden track 'Train In Vain' is essential pop rock. The playing is top notch and everyone delivers here. A masterpiece 
"
pos,"Absolutely fantastic album, by far one of the ten best albums, and I say this as a fan of the Who, Bowie, Beatles and several other artists that differ greatly from Punk. Never dare compare the Clash to bands like Guns N Roses, because there is no comparison, despite how Guns N' Roses achieved more success."
pos,"Having been a young man at the time and already digging the Clash, when this came out, I, like everyone else on the planet wasn't prepared for, well, basically something as good as the best of The Beatles or the Stones. I mean this album was just a monumental leap into the excellent. They didn't have to leap far - but every track is brilliant. And the variety? Get the heck outta here. It's right up there with the White album and Exile On Main Street. I won't go into this or that or anything else about it other than to say, it way opened my mind to all kinds of musical ideas.

I will add this horribly curious bit though - if you go on Wikipedia's article for London Calling and scan the critical responses with the various rating systems you'll notice that Spin Alternative Record Guide lists the album at 7/10. I almost blew coffee out my nose. That's basically say, ""Hey, we're stupid and we want the whole world to know it!"". I mean I admire rebels but to give this album, in a world of good, bad and mediocre albums piling up by the minute anything less than a perfect rating is really exposing yourself to such a loss of respect that one should expect to go out of business just for that. 
Oops, funny how things work. I would re-review that album, Spin. Get in the time machine."
pos,Punk with inventive.and Eclectic The best punk record since the Pistols debut.This is the definition of FUN.Get up and dance.
pos,"The best rock and roll album of all time. I can not reason it or explain it, just can say it from the heart."
pos,"nearly every track has something to offer. The Clash at their peak were certainly something to behold, as they managed to leave their rebellious ethos intact while maturing both musically and lyrically in every conceivable fashion. The band proves that they can translate the heart of punk into an arena wholly divorced from the limiting, constraining conventions of the genre, expressing anger and indignation without shouting and rawness and passion without derivative, primitive arrangements. Thus the Clash retained everything beneficial about the punk movement while shedding everything deleterious to their growth and progression as artists, resulting in the strongest product the group was capable of and a milestone for generations to come."
pos,"This is one of the least reliable Allmusic reviews I have seen. Sandinista! is a force of nature, flaws and all. Much like the White Album or Physical Graffiti, or a movie like Apocalypse Now, it is a sprawling statement of purpose in which an artist puts it ALL out there for our consideration. The Clash were always the punk band that mostly listened to non punk music, and here is their celebration of that. And it is a celebration of world rhythms, an absolute clinic for rhythm sections and simply one of the best drum albums ever made. Weird, long, stoned, varied, political, moody - listen to Sandinista! with an open mind and you will be rewarded forever."
pos,"While I agree with Mr. Erlewine's statement that Sandinista includes some of the Clash's best work and some lesser experimental tracks, I disagree with his overall rating. Yes, the kids singing Career Opportunities is annoying (though I guess there was a point being made) and there is too much dub and xylophone interspersed throughout the album. However, the Beatles White Album had some weird ""filler"" type songs as well. I'm not saying this is the White Album, but even with Sandinista's weaker tracks you still have a five star album that may even surpass London Calling in terms of songwriting and musical groundbreaking. Certainly Sandinista continued and accelerated the evolution of a one-dimensional, angry punk-rock band into a band that was way more talented and creative than anyone expected."
pos,"I really think AllMusic is ""off"" on this rating, and y'all are usually so reliable and solid! Please take an hour to re-evaluate this incredibly diverse and influential album...it's my favorite Clash album and one of my favs of all time! Maybe you were just tired or in a bad mood---listen again and see if it's not at least a ""4-Star"", or even more! Thanx!"
pos,"I rely a good bit on AllMusic's reviews, and esp. Erlewine's. but with Sandinista he is way off IMO. The weaker tracks, the dubs, the experiments are as much a part of this sprawling statement as the hits are. I see Sandinista as a logical follow-up to ""London Calling"". It was still another step up. They walked the talk: ""taking it as far as it can go"". In the documentary about Strummer, Joe stands behind this album 100%."
pos,"sandinista has improved with time. It's flawed: overall the production isn't consistent and tends to be too reverby (fine on the dub tracks, but too wet for funk and rock), there's the experiments and quirky filler. But while I found these tedious at the time, because I wanted another London Calling, listening to it thirty odd years later, it's really absorbing. And there are some absolute classics."
pos,"The comparison is Harrison's All Things Must Pass, which is, in my opinion, a classic, and might be the best that any Beatles ever recorded (as a Beatle or otherwise). It is five-stars. I say this, despite the fact that it is really a two disc record with a throw-away third of jams that nobody listens to. Allmusic apparently agrees. By contrast, they give Sandinista 2.5 stars (!). If I limit my attention to the 19 best songs on this album (i.e., a London Calling), I have an album that is just a bit less spectacular than London Calling (and ATMP).. Throw away the rest like we all do with the third record of ATMP. Two and one-half stars. That's asinine and Allmusic should pull this review."
pos,"Sandinista! reflects the peak of The Clash musical career, at a time they moved away from pure punk rock to integrate reggae, dub, and gospel influences, becoming a band of universal appeal. Yet, the album is a mixed bag, where gems (Magnificent Seven, One More Time, Somebody Got Murdered, The Call Up, Police on My Back, Washington Bullets, Lose This Skin,...), alternate with average if not weak, though somewhat experimental, pieces. Maybe the Clash were just the victims of indulgent editing, offering a blend of successful and failed musical experiments. But in a sense, isn't this what punk rock is all about?
"
pos,"Kurt Cobain once said that this record was the reason he couldn't listen to Punk Music for years, this being his first introduction to the genre. Sandinista isn't punk however, it's more of a wild experiment that spans three records and a colossal range of genres. Sandinista! Is the Clash's White Album, except less chaotic (almost). Genres range from Funk/Rap music ('The Magnificent Seven'), their usual punk stylings ('Police On My Back', 'Somebody Got Murdered'), avant-garde ('Mensforth Hill') to Gospel ('The Sound of Sinners'), along with many many more crammed in between. The Clash also experiment heavily with Dub music. Side 6 of the original record is mainly comprised of Dub remixes of early tracks on the record or other songs on the album. DJ Mickey Dread produces the record, and features on a few of the Dub tracks, along with Violinist Tymon Dogg taking lead on his own track 'Lose This Skin'. Bizarrely, the children of Mickey Gallagher of the Blockheads singing a cover of 'Career Opportunities' in one of the record's more surreal moments. 'London Calling' was defiantly a much more focused album and as such, it succeeds much more. The extra disc brings the record down a tad amount in terms of quality. The rocking 'Charlie Don't Surf' and 'Kingston Advice' are the standouts here, though the dub tracks are certainly a good bit of fun Sandinista! Suffers slightly because of the sheer amount of tracks and I certainly applaud the Clash for their efforts to give the fans more content, and at a low price as well. The band are spectacular as always but the record needs some editing. 
Other than that it's certainly not the worst album ever made like some hardcore fans see it as, it has its detractors but it's a certainly a very fun filled romp"
pos,"How do you rate this one? There is certainly a four-star album hidden among the tracks, but it's hard to recommend the whole thing to anyone. More than anything, the album is a testimony of the band's hubris at this point in their career. Typical is the choice of title, after the most fashionable revolutionary case at the time. Sad to behold after the greatness of London Calling!"
pos,"This is a admittedly a difficult record. That being said this has been my favorite Clash album for many years and that has never changed. The reason being it?s shambolic nature and that they had the guts to do something so broad in scope. So while there is filler and head scratching moments, art doesn?t have to be concise and to the point. That?s what this is the bands artistic masterpiece that broke a lot more rules than what many in the scene were doing outside of a brave few like the Pop Group, and PIL."
pos,"This is an incredible album. Lots of different styles on display here. Not a hardcore punk album certainly, Sandinista! features a lot of reggae and dub. But the Clash perform this style with their own brand of mastery. A full complement of excellent music (2 and 1/2 hours worth), with few missteps."
pos,"This album is one part amazing, one part REALLY weird, and one part a mix of the two. It's very easy to listen to this album and go from ""This is amazing"" to ""What the hell were they thinking?"" and that's almost the beauty of it. Almost. Variety is indeed the spice of life, but if you put every single spice in existence on your sandwich, you may not like it."
pos,"The Clash's Sandinista is hardly disheartening. On the contrary, it galvanized my impression that this was not just another British punk band. This was already apparent on London Calling, but Sandinista sealed the deal. The Clash were something really special because they had a strong message of rebellion and anti-status quo attitude, but they were also great musicians. This is a a very strong album."
pos,"Sandinista!, while undeniably a flawed product, is far from the debacle it's often vilified as; on the contrary, I'd call it a resounding success, as while it may not match its ambitions with comparable content it remains a very strong affair, filled with bona fide Clash classics and material that's just engaging enough to prevent the listener from lapsing into a state of boredom after an onslaught of over two hours."
pos,"Come on, what's better than a whole mess of Clash? Don't analyze - fall into it. It is a psych/dub album really. Just put on the headphones and strap yourself down for the trip. The lively cuts are double as dance floor fillers but also don't require so much militant allegiance as the anthemic numbers on London Calling. So much more organic and easy going than London Calling. Sandinista said ""Everybody, let's party!"" and London Calling took you by the ear and forced you to pay attention. Sandinista is a rollicking good time that dares you to drift off, sending the listener off like a boomerang into the ether, then snapping them back with a classic anthem that does not demand attention so much as generate a collective appreciation for their journey. So many solid performances backing up Mick and Joe's vision. This is Topper's best album, and Paul's as well. Messy, orchestral, trippy, driving music. A rambling, shambolic Clash orgasm."
pos,"Sandinista is fucked, but in a good way. The Only Band That Matters explore every corner of their inspiration, to various degrees of success. This could have been a great single album, but then Clash completists would be searching for all the misfires anyway. Just enjoy the ride. They'd be done soon enough."
pos,It's clearly complementary to London Calling and shows wonderful chutzpah and adventure on the part of the Clash. For All music to give it the poor rating tells me that this first and last review from me will be my best way to show my profound disagreement. I am reflecting on all the music that is rated higher . I was 28 when this glorious recording came along and captured the times.
pos,"After the Clash were done fighting themselves on Sandanista! they decided to take on the world. Combat Rock is the best title for this record because the songs herein are fighting words. As the poster boys for punk rock, the Clash were lauded with some serious expectations. They were supposed to be the only band that mattered, the last gang in town ? more importantly, they had outlived the Sex Pistols. And while the Pistols? legacy was spoken for, the Clash still had pavement under their wheels with plenty of gas left in the tank. At least in 1981.

In 1981, their collaborative efforts were rivaling the Beatles. Not only had Mick Jones given the band their first charting success with ?Train In Vain?, he had managed to strike oil in the same place twice with ?Should I Stay I Should I Go?. And then Topper Headon really joined the party when he presented ?Rock the Casbah? in its entirety. Joe Strummer, the Andrew Jackson that he could be at times, opted to rewrite another Clash classic from love song to revolution rock (?I?m So Bored With You? famously became ""I'm So Bored With the U.S.A."") and ? boom. Butt moving, thought provoking radio play. But, as the case usually goes with the most handsome member of the band, Paul SImonon?s ?Red Angel Dragnet? is left to its own jah devices. Beat poet patriarch Allen Ginsberg even gets time on the mic. The Clash were making art rock of the highest order, daring anyone to call them liars.

They had shown the world their cards with London Calling; and with a winning deck, one always must maintain their momentum. Instead of snuffing hip-hop and funk and poetry and all the stuff that wasn?t supposed to be punk rock, the Clash turned down the scene kids and turned up the ghetto blasters. Sandanista! is loaded with experiments, but Combat Rock is the steady infantry ready to kick some real ass. ?Ghetto Defendant? and ?Car Jamming? bounce and pulse with the streets of Harlem. If there was one thing Paul Simonon and Mick Jones could agree on it was rhythm, and boy does the bass shine on this album. Like Adam Clayton or Jeff Ament, Simonon has a most remarkable style based around clever modesty. Imagining ?Overpowered By Funk? or ?Straight To Hell? without that middle-grounded Fender P Bass is nothing to spend time worrying about..

Language is also very important to Combat Rock. As I mentioned earlier, ?Know Your Rights? and ?Death Is A Star? are fighting words, fully realized ruminations of a class of intellectuals not yet recognized in a public forum. Like Woody Guthrie, Jack Kerouac or Bob Dylan, Joe Strummer was a man with a cause, even when that cause wasn?t even apparent to himself. Communication was always his goal, though. He once said, ?I think we?re going to have to forget about the radio and just go back to word of mouth.? If telling stories is the blood of rock-and-roll, then Combat Rock is an earnest pulsing heart."
pos,"Combat rock includes three main singles, two of which are among the most famous of The Clash's discography. The first is ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" that got great placements on Billboard, top 100 and topstream rankings, UK. The second is Rock in the Casbah, which was almost released at the same time as ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" and achieved remarkable market results. In 1982, it reached eight of the Billboard Hot 100 rankings in the United States (while Straight to Hell is a provocative 'song-manifest').And with Atom Tan, the old Clash returns, though (And here's the most enigmatic track):Sean Flynn and the most blues-reggae Ghetto defendant.and just like many bands before them, this was something continued their glorious legacy, but brought something new upon the blackboard as well."

pos,"The Clash was Rock and Roll reborn, raging, raw, strutting with a whiff of fire and brimstone. The drums pummeled, the guitars rang, the bass pulsated and throbbed predatorily as the vocals wailed, chanted, and made their declarations: This is Combat Rock!

If a touch uneven, the best moments on this album are so powerful that as a whole Combat Rock is undeniable! It sounds like the best parts of the summer of 1982 are alive and well and never going to end."
pos,"Much of the content is rather mediocre but these defects are invariably eclipsed by the superior material. It's certainly a far cry from the brilliance of their prior work, and indeed Combat Rock was the band's weakest offering to this point, but it's still an enjoyable listen, a solid affair highlighted by a few genuine Clash classics."
pos,"Combat Rock saw The Clash perfecting the fine balance they'd always craved: artistic credibility and commercial success. New listeners were drawn in by the danceable Islamic Revolution-inspired tale 'Rock The Casbah' and the arena anthem 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go Now', meaning that Joe Strummer and Mick Jones provided a major hit each.

But a musical divide between the two was growing and at the very pinnacle of their popularity, The Clash had in fact reached the end of the road, as one more very difficult album would subsequently prove."
pos,"This is an album that has benefited from being forgotten 31 years ago. When it was released in 1985, the impact of the original band was still fresh in memory. I used to call them ""The Only Band That Matters."" Without Mick Jones, the band now sounded formulamatic; the songs seemed forced instead of forceful. But in retrospect, ""Cut the Crap!"" ain't bad at all. Even at it's most trite, the Clash was/is heads above every other band. ""This is England"" is the standout cut. And listen for the pumping synthesizers on ""Movers and Shakers."" For sheer audacity, the band reminds us that ""We Are the Clash.""This may have been so dismissed upon release that I never bothered to listen. Which is why it may sound so fresh now. It's like getting a gift from a long-lost friend - unexpected and welcome."
neg,This is a case of a band becoming their worst nightmare (though by this time it is not really the Clash anymore). Drum machines and cheesy synthesizers. It is just too bad Strummer never recorded a good version of This is England. Could have been a standout of the core line up reunion rumored right before Strummer died.
neg,"The album was such a fiasco that Strummer himself even renounced it in retrospect, but that wasn't enough to prevent Cut The Crap from tainting the band's otherwise nearly immaculate reputation. The record is the worst swansong imaginable for a group of the caliber of the Clash, an utter debacle arriving after five solid to excellent outings. Whether the album's quality is a repercussion of Jones' departure, the product of Rhodes' unadvised meddling in the band's creative direction or a symptom of Strummer's inevitable stagnation is irrelevant; the point is that the group had produced an abomination that sadly irrevocably tarnished the image of ""the only rock group that matters,"" showing that even the greatest of rock outfits were capable of massive artistic misfires."
neg,"With ideal hindsight, The Clash would have bowed out after one final glorious single, 'This Is England' in late 1983-early 1984. Instead, it got released 18 months later, sans Mick Jones and bundled with this affront to one of the greatest rock bands of all-time. Joe Strummer writes it off as a colossal mistake, as do most Clash fans. It's better to pretend that they split up after the Combat Rock tour, because after firing Jones and Topper Headon (albeit for reasons much more of Headon's doing), that's essentially what they did. One album cannot taint five of pure genius, no matter how hard it tries."
pos,"Cut the crap in my opinion is still a very good album and I really enjoyed it, It doesn't deserve all the hate it gets, Joe Strummer even admitted that this is england is one of the strongest clash singles and I definitely agree, It's nice to see that the record is better received today than it was back in 1985 which is good because Cut the crap is still a awesome album and does definitely deserve more attention, I think all 6 clash albums are all brilliant in there own individual way."
pos,"The best MBV album. The sound, the style and the melodies."
pos,"""Isn't Anything"" is often overlooked in favor of the superior ""Loveless"". However, I think it's a near equal. This is one of the first shoegaze albums ever produced. Musically, it is a cross between The Jesus and Mary Chain and Sonic Youth. At times, the record even reminded me of The Velvet Underground's debut with Nico. Singer-songwriters Kevin Shields and Bilinda Butcher deliver haunting vocals on songs that alternate between being punky and dark. This is a groundbreaking LP that ranks up with the best alternative rock from the late 1980's. A true stunner."
pos,"It?s likely that fans of My Bloody Valentine arrived at ?Isn?t Anything? via two distinct directions. Firstly, there?s the buyer that was inspired by the excellent dissonant noise of their August ?88 single ?You Made Me Realise? which reached number two in the U.K. independent charts. Secondly (and far more likely), it?s the lovers of 1991?s noisefest collection ?Loveless?, who are back tracking to find out where the source of inspiration came to create one of the decade?s most influential recordings. Whatever the route, the resultant long player is a relative disappointment. 

It?s neither a positive progression from the preceding single (or E.P), nor does it sound anything like ?Loveless?. Mainly recorded in a tiny studio in the back woods near Welshpool, the collection captures a time when Kevin Shields and co. were attempting to find an outlet that reflected their lives; the irritation at the outside world, casual sex, squatting and vegetating. Unlike later recordings, Shields hasn?t the confidence to use the studio as a tool to develop his swelling, reverb laden soundscapes, and the resultant LP is an unconvincing, thinly produced, amateurishly performed, and at times an unfocused mess. When interviewed on ITV?s Night Network a few weeks before release, Shield?s answer to the question ?What does your music reflect?? was a shrugging ?Dunno, we don?t really know what we?re doing?. His answer to further probing; ?What?s the subject matter?? was a simple ?...confusion?.

As if to highlight the lack of clarity, the opener (?Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside)?) is quite possibly the most banal tuneless dirge from this collection, with a rhythmic flow that seems like it?s stuck in tar. Bilinda Butcher?s dreamy vocal rescues the sluggish ?Lose My Breath?, and the harder pre-grunge instrumental aggression of ?(When You Wake) You?re Still In A Dream?, ?You Never Should? and the single ?Feed Me With Your Kiss?, sound infinitely more convincing. In time, and much to the annoyance of Creation boss Alan McGee, Shields would become a studio dabbler, spending hours washing his music with waves upon waves of guitar shards, feedback, and echo to develop a style that would of course be labelled shoegaze. The emphasis moved away from conventional songs, as on this record, and his direction took the course of creating an aural collage of distortion, droning riffs, sampled loops and obscured vocals that would eventually appear on ?Loveless?.

Sadly, the content of ?Isn?t Anything? reflects its title. It sees My Bloody Valentine coming to terms with their abilities as songwriters and the results are at best adequate, at worst plainly pedestrian."
pos,"Born in 1959, my first genuine life changing record was Roxy Music's 1972 self-titled LP. By the way, the only LP with Eno and Fripp's contributions. The first song on side one, the seldom heard Re-Make Re-Model was a game changer. Television's first. Wow. How about Devo's 1977 first, produced by Eno no less. All game changers. The first REM EP was amazing, but it wasn't until, what, 1991's Loveless that I experienced a truly mind crushing rush of an unknown power, an explosion of genius. I like 1000's of amazing bands, jazz to rock, Etta James to 19 year old Alex G., I love all good music. This is a record that transcends genres. Nevermind establishing shoegaze, this album rises above it all like very few recordings ever have. Good music is timeless, from our inner and outer spaces, and this LP defines much more than what is heard on the surface. Matter in it's basic form is math, and music particle waves. The physics embedded within these sounds: astounding"
pos,"An album that will really pushes the envelope of what can be done with sonic textures; ""Loveless"" for me is a perfect album. From the sonic attack of ""Only Shallow"" till the soft fade of""Soon"" the music never stops but at the same time I never want it to. Considered the zenith of the ""shoegaze"" movement, Loveless was the album that Kevin Shields really wanted to design and he spent a significant amount of resources to complete his dream.

The albums sound can be described as noise pop mixed with dream pop with some goth and electronica to add flavour. From the beginning, you are introduced to this Phil Spectorish wall of sound that completely envelops the listener and almost like a high thrill rollercoaster continues throughout the rest of the album. This is not to say that the album is just one big sonic attack, there are moments of bliss found throughout the album in the forms of ""to Here Knows When"" or ""Blown a Wish"" but these songs serve as wonderful introduction to such hard songs such ""I Only Said"" or ""What You Want"". As a personal comment, I think the song that encapsulates the album is the magnificent ""Sometimes"" which I considered one of the best songs ever recorded.

An album that is comparable to a sonic orgasm, I find ""Loveless"" to be one of the highest statements in music ever, and I think that this album goes beyond alternative music and goes into realms of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" or ""Exile on Main Street"". A powerful moment in 90's rock and in music in general, ""Loveless"" is a masterpiece from first note to last."
pos,"In the midst of the short lived shoegaze scene of about 1988-1991, this album hit me like a bombshell. It was as if an alien artifact had dropped out of the sky and slammed into my skull. ""Loveless"" stood like the monolith in ""2001"" my mind: implacable and irrefutable. Challenging me to understand. The album frankly made a mockery of earlier attempts at the genre. This album is similar to Hendrix's debut: it created such a unique and encompassing world of its own that other similar works were instantly diminished and obsolete. This was the real McCoy, an ""adult portion"" of sensuality, disorientation, power, fear, drive and ecstatic release. Twenty-six years since, the world still hasn't caught up. A timeless masterpiece. If you haven't heard it and are at all intrigued by what you read, I'm jealous of you. Dig in."
pos,"For many, hearing this album for the first time is a life-changing experience. (Sure, for some it will be ""what is this noise?""...) For those amenable to it, it takes you to another realm. There's also something about it that lends itself to being played extremely loudly. You don't have to in order to appreciate it, but sometimes that fits my mood in a way no other album before or since does."
pos,"One of the more challenging albums I've heard lately. MBV's legendary Loveless is not exactly the most immediately approachable album, heck for a lot of listeners, it's almost the opposite of immediate. It's the kind of record that draws you in after testing individual tracks multiple times and from there you can tell, likely rewards repeated listens. Upon my first listen to the album, I was definitely intrigued which means that if I'm right, I might find myself coming back to this album in the future."

pos,"Another somewhat overrated '90s rock, er, masterpiece. But unlike NEVERMIND and OK COMPUTER, which had rather broad appeal, this one is genre-defining to a fault. Those inclined to this particular type of art rock will probably be bowled over; others will be left to wondering just why the vocals are so buried in the mix - which is to say, will miss the point entirely. This is the best of its kind, whether you want to call it Pomo, Shoegaze, or Noise Rock. Whatever it is, it's a gleaming, harrowing, over-the-top classic that still retains its power."
pos,"I'm hearing this groundbreaking album for the first time in 2019; somehow I missed it back in the '90's. So is it worthy of the accolades received over the past 28 years? Yes. Inoffensive but catchy pop tunes with recessed vocals and uninspired drumming are drowned in multiple layers of distorted and dissonant electric guitars. The overall effect is introspective and claustrophobic and actually works very well. This is music that does not grab you but rather draws you in gradually. It can be a tough listen, especially at first, and listening to the entire album in one sitting is difficult. Listening in shorter segments over time is rewarding as it reveals the multiple layers of craftsmanship. This is a 5-star album but not for the unadventurous."
pos,"The way that Loveless is adorable and noisy is quite intriguing. Hard listening and assimilate at the first time, it requires time to be appreciated of the correct way."
pos,"What is there to say about Loveless that hasn?t already been said? It never seemed, in the early nineties, that it would ever be so talked about. But the truth is I tuned out on the MBV talk long ago, even though in 1998 when a Bowie freak and an Elvis freak asked me which artist?s albums I?d take to a desert island I said My Bloody Valentine?s (all two of them). Well, I was still mourning a lost love?the pivotal point of my young life?which had been born amid a Loveless and LSD haze. My girlfriend and I would sing along (or hum, since we couldn?t hear the words) while we made love, woman and man accorded equal spotlight on MBV?s stage. Back then I had no idea what MBV looked like: I saw them (men and women both) waif-thin in sheer satin, silk or leather. And I would have been happy to persist in that illusion: the pink guitar was all the imagery I needed. Of course soon enough I discovered Isn?t Anything (with its band photo), and the early EPs. All are great?in some ways better (or more wildly inventive) than Loveless, but not as easy to get lost in. Given Kevin Shields himself seems to think Loveless was a misfire, I can see the flaws: its kind of flat, one-dimensional, lacking light and shade; it?s what it suggests that?s most powerful. Still, what a suggestion! To a degree, despite the copycats, I doubt there?s been a more futuristic record in rock, at least in this vein. And on reflection I don?t think it?s all about guitar technique. (After all, Brian Eno did the synoptic whammy-bar trick on Here Come the Warm Jets in 1973.) What was MBV?s secret weapon? Ingenuous as it may sound, the songs?the off-kilter melodies, beguiling chord-changes, sweet-and-sour disposition. (?You Never Should?, from Isn?t Anything, always struck me as their breakthrough, and I?d love to have heard it Loveless-ised.) Oh yeah, and of course the delicate balance of the sexes: the future of rock, after all, is part-female. There are caveats: Shields turned demagogue, and squeezed Loveless of band dynamics. (On the other hand, Colm ? C¡os¢ig?s jerky garage-band drumming could never have cut through on this level.) From what I gather (I?ve barely listened to it), the 20-years-in-the-making M B V continues the trend. Me, I?ve got no time for an MBV that doesn?t reinvent the sound, and relegates the melodies to a supporting role. Truth is I rarely even spin Loveless these days?it?s too wound up in those days. But I know it to be solid gold. Along with Slint?s Spiderland, probably the last time guitar music truly blew me away. The sound of sensual overload. And one of four or five records that changed my life."
pos,"One of the best examples, what noise flirtation with pop can give. Songwriting of Shields, Butcher and rest of the group is powerful and shows, that the most beautiful and spiritual feel can also come from pure electric guitar noise, no matter if we mention quadruple, roaring guitar riff of ""Only Shallow"", short and groaning instrumental ""Touched"", catchy, but also emotionally evocative hook of ""When You Sleep"", shimmeringly and aggresively grinding ""Come in Alone"" or simple, hook-filled structure of ""Soon"". When it comes to sensing, where is the thin red line that marks the border between unlistenable scratches and drones and catchy, corny bubblegum pop, MBV beats many contemporary shoegaze, noise pop and noise-rock bands. This album left indisputable influence behind. Astounding."
pos,"Shields had to know he was setting himself up for criticism by making this album. Loveless is in a class by itself; no one is going to ever compete with it. The question is whether this is a good album in its own right. To me the answer is yes. Given how boring rock music has been this decade, any good album is a breath of fresh air. If this album fails, it fails due to others' expectations for it.

This is a simpler album than its predecessor. Most songs center on building a groove around a simple melody with an appropriate soundscape surrounding it. Only Tomorrow gets into a groove with an amazing fat guitar hook that you want to last forever. Is This And Yes takes things in a new direction with keyboards that are both delicate and piercing at the same time. New You is almost funky.

My only issue is with the last two tracks. Nothing Is is a bit too repetitive for me and might have been better relegated to a b-side. Wonder 2 hints at a direction for the future with a harder drum-and-bass sound that might have been better off as the lead track for a completely different album. It would have been fine to me if this album dropped those two tracks and came in under 40 minutes. This was never going to be a masterpiece of an album. It is still very good!"
pos,"M B V sounds a bit like a new Slowdive album. Which wouldn't be a bad thing if Slowdive didn't already exist and did even surprise us with a new album after a year-long hiatus too !
This is certainly not bad album, as some say, it's even a very strong shoegaze album. 
Only, Kevin Shields spoiled us with the revolutionary work of art which was Loveless. Even ""Isn't Anything"" sounded like a jetplane in times of horse and carriage.
M B V just sounds like a thousand other great alternative rock records of the nineties. That's simply not enough for fans who kept waiting for 20 years for another step into outer space.

By the way, the last 2 tracks, which some here call too repetitive, are the only tracks which are hinting towards ""something else"" ... maybe a path worth checking for Kevin Shields ?"
pos,"This is My Bloody Valentine's first album in 22 years and its essentially a sequel to its predecessor ""Loveless"". Just like that 1991 record, it features a very stylish and distorted pop/rock sound. Some listeners might argue the record doesn't live up to the hype. That it doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from what came before. But while it may not push the envelope by much, this is still a very dazzling piece of music. I wouldn't rank it as highly as the band's previous work, but I do hold it in very high esteem."
pos,"Just finish listening to the album, it is amazing, definitely the best gallagher job after oasis. It is rock and rol, it is pop, it is physicodelicy, even got some liam's 80s ""dance"" influentials like happy mondays on wall of glass for example. Great album"
neg,"There are few things more annoying than a bunch of critics gushing over an long and highly awaited album simply because of a band's cult status. I too was eager to dive into this album when it was released. However, after the first couple songs it quickly gets perplexing. This is what we have all been waiting for 20+ years for? This album is nothing more than a lazy, half-baked collection of studio sketches lacking any originality or compositional value whatsoever. An embarrassingly bad effort."
neg,"I didn't find a single track on this album memorable in either song quality or production value. I expected an album of dense soundscapes interwoven with beautiful melodies. Instead I got some half baked ideas and boring arrangements. Loveless was an album chock full of gut wrenchingly beautiful melodies and brilliantly subtle, shifting arrangements. MBV is an album of underdeveloped schlock that sounds like a sloppy hybrid of My Bloody Valentine B-sides and modern MOR indie rock. Shields should have dedicated all his time post-Loveless honing his skills, scoring movies, and producing the records of others if he ever wished to make a follow up that built upon his previous work like Graham Sutton did with Bark Psychosis. I know that Shields wasn't a complete recluse during this time and his work with Primal Scream especially was excellent, but Shields sounds like he phoned this one in. He should have brought back Alan Moulder. Big let down."
neg,"As different as the previous albums it lacks of melodies. My Bloody Valentine were not just noise, were melodies and they were beautiful. Liking the just because its sounds it' s for amateurs"
pos,"this album is a big event in a lot of people's eyes. Before listening to it I thought it would live up to the hype. But then when I did listen to it, I was a bit underwhelmed. It opens well with a good energy that shows the kind of intent you'd expect. It falls down a bit in the middle and by the end I was kinda glad it was finishing. I just think if he'd collaborated with other writers on a few of the tracks he solely wrote, then that could've taken the album up a level. But overall, as far as a debut album is concerned it's definitely a decent starting point that he can build upon."
pos,"Even an excellent band like Kasabian, which fishes a bit in the same pond as Liam does here but catches way better and bigger fish, hasn't made a 5 star album yet.
The lyrics are absolutely ri-di-cu-lous ... rarely heard lyrics so clich‚ ... nursery rhymes for the sake of rhyming. Minus 1 star. 
The songs are often barely disguised ripp-offs of Beatles, Stones, Oasis, Blur, Kasabian, Ian Brown, etc ...
Minus one more star.
The only things which save the album are Liam's voice, still a ravaging rock vehicle, and his undeniable honesty, enthusiasm and drive. He sounds like a man who wants to prove something to some brother by kicking him in the head as hard as he can.
The cover picture is top too."

neg,"few good musical moments are blatant copies of the good old days . Cheesy lyrics, even bring down the best song on the album - For what it's worth . The second best one - Come Back To Me 
is brought down by an overplaied and unnecessary guitar solo . Poor ."
pos,I just can say Ourkid is doing an amazing job right here
neg,Awful album every second is fucking dreadful ugly album
pos,"This offering is a semi-glossy, slightly moving, skin deep affair, with moderate hints at a deeper, yet vaguely present purpose. 

No one can deny Harry Styles? charisma, good looks and charmingly magnetic vocal delivery. And his stage persona has evolved nicely to include subtleties that one could estimate falling somewhere between INXS? Michael Hutchence and Roxy Music?s Bryan Ferry.

The album, though not a world changer by any stretch of the imagination, is an easy listen. There are no surprises or unexpected fireworks. Probably most important, it represents a glimpse into things to come from Harry Styles the solo artist. And, on that basis, future offerings may very well be quite interesting ? just as soon as he begins to define his place in a world of voices.

All in all, it was difficult for me to separate the sound and presentation of this album from similar releases of Beck, Young the Giant, Killers or Typhoon. At times during a critical listening of this album I did detect some subtle qualities similar to Matthew Sweet, Bread?s David Gates, Steve Miller and even T. Rex.

The tracks that showed the most promise for me as the truest representation of Mr. Styles the artist at this stage in his career are: Sign of the Times, Two Ghosts and Ever Since New York."
pos,"Let It Be' hit the shelves the following Spring, but the World and its mother knew and knows that 'Abbey Road' is the Beatles' true sendoff. Ironically for an album that one might presume is a farewell ode to the iconic Lennon/McCartney partnership, it's Harrison who provides THE two sparkling moments with 'Here Comes The Sun' and 'Something', signifying a creative hot streak that would become truly apparent on 'All Things Must Pass'. 'Come Together' is of particular note as being the only Beatles number that John played at his final full length concerts at MSG in 1972, while McCartney's closing medley serves as a fitting finale, containing just a little bit of everything that made him arguably the pre-eminent pop songwriter of the '60s and possibly even the '70s. With great respect, I think it's also more appropriate that a Paul suite ended the Beatles' active career rather than something from John, as despite the integral pathos and social gravitas that Lennon bought to every one of their studio masterpieces, ultimately the Fab Four were seen as a 'happy' band overall and so it was only right that a touch of McCartney whimsy sent them off into the (sadly initially bitter and legally troubled) sunset.
Very enjoyable many diverse styles, well crafted"
pos,There?s nothing negative about this release.
pos,"Its nice, but it seems that something is holding back the album from becoming something more. Which is ironic because the debut itself is dynamic, or at least it tries to be."
pos,"It's hard to achieve the level of success that One Direction had reached in the 2010's, but being who I would consider the most diverse member of the group, Harry puts his all into this record. It surprises me greatly that Harry's debut album does not include more poppy, produced tracks that I was expecting. Harry really pulls out his artistry on songs like Sign of the Times, offering a very Beck-ish Sea Change era tune. Another album highlight is Kiwi which offers a more Rock-oriented approach and It goes over incredibly well. Sadly the worst track on this album is the opener, Meet Me in the Hallway. But in the end, Harry takes it home with a great album, that if he pursues more of a solo career, will be tough to beat."
pos,"Listening to this album makes me want to head-bang, slow dance, drunkenly dance, and just sit in the car and close my eyes as the warm breeze washes over me and wafts through my hair all at the same time. What other album can make you feel all this at once? I have yet to find out! Honestly, this album is just my jam. It's edgy, new, old, fantastic, and has all the right drums, vocals, and guitar riffs and acoustics."
pos,Excellent debut album. Stands out on its own. Nice combination of styles and good crafted songs.
neg,This album has so bad mix and mastering . deep compress and richly wet . but a few ideas and concepts that worth to listen to it .
neg,"Here's what I think: how about we give it a 1 for Heartless? It's catchy until you've listened to it for a few times. As for the rest of the album: no thanks. Some artists CAN decide to try another genre and do a good job with it, but others (like Kanye West) should keep doing what they're good at, or at least make some very high-production songs in their new genre. I don't know, but I think this style is better suited to Mariah Carey or Beyonc‚. For a (now ex-) rapper to be singing songs like these, even if they do come from the heart, just doesn't fit."
neg,"How the mighty have fallen, the innovator is now the imitator. Kayne used to be the breath of fresh air in an otherwise played out, commercialized genre. I can respect Kanye doing something off the beaten path of his usual, but is it really necessary to use the Vocal Auto-Tuner on every track? This album feels like it was thrown together to be released for the Christmas sales rush. Why else would he abuse the vocal auto-tuner that is so popular right now? I mean, Jim Jones now has a track out that uses this crap. I like Dip-Set, but come on! There are going to be people that say this album is genius and that Kanye ventured out to create something different, and yet others that feel they wasted their money on straight garbage (myself included). There are maybe 2 tracks that I could somewhat listen to all the way (I have yet to listen to the entire album just because I can't stand this commercial garbage). Kayne, you went 2 for 12, a 16% total rating. I went into this album expecting great things, but all I got was a lot of Heartbreak."
neg,"This album is terrible, Kanye should have saved it until after he was dead."
neg,"very happy that there is a option to give a zero for an album. if there was ever an album made that was a disgrace to hip hop and deserved a zero, this is one. what a waste of time. when you are not that good of a rapper and you put something like this out, your career should be in big trouble. i hope he stops polluting our airwaves soon with this garbage"
neg,"Heartless, is a maybe upgrade to 1 until i heard it more than twice. Kanye was good until he got his hands on some money and now he wants some more and more and it becomes about money not the music, like it was when he first started sad to see one of my favorite emcees drop down this low."
neg,"shocking shocking album, that auto-tune is seriously annoying"
neg,"Following the release of ""Carry On"" for the Call of Duty Arms: Black Ops II video game, Avenged Sevenfold returned to the studio with new drummer, Arin Ilejay of Confide, to record 2013's Hail to the King. In a press announcement, vocalist M. Shadows announced they would be attempting to go back to their Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin roots, and at the surface, the idea of dumbing down their music to sturdy classic rock grooves made a lot of sense, since many of the compositions on their last two albums had become overwrought with studio overdubbing. Unfortunately, once they tried to take inspiration from other bands, they mimicked them so well that they lost their sense of identity in the process. ""Doing Time"" came straight out of the Guns N' Roses songbook, ""This Means War"" is a direct rip of Metallica's ""Sad But True,"" and ""Crimson Day"" could be any number of '80s hair metal power ballads. By the album's second half, Avenged Sevenfold can't help but let loose their guitar shredding theatrics a bit, and their personality starts to shine through as the tempo quickens and tracks take flight to unabashed heights. ""Heretic"" and ""Coming Home"" are still firmly indebted to their roots (specifically, Megadeth and Iron Maiden) but they are exciting metal numbers, and they set the stage for the colossal ""Planets,"", which incorporates motifs from ""The Planets"" suite by 20th century composer Gustav Holstand includes all the arpeggiated soloing and operatic yowling you could ever want. If this sounds ridiculous, that's because it is, but it's undeniably more fun to hear the members pushing themselves and showboating than doing mock covers."
neg,"This is the first big failure Kanye West has ever had. Auto tune is ruining rap, and slowly taking the best artists with it."
neg,"WHY KANYE! WHY! The biggest WTF record of his career and the auto-tune, don't get me started on the auto-tune. This is his worst and will probably be his worst LP of his career when he's all done. Not to mention his worst producing effort so far. All his greatest attributes go to waste. Sorry folks, just a poor effort from one of Hip-Hop's biggest talents."
neg,"This is Kanye's weakest album. I found most of the songs intolerable, and the rest of it was simply boring. The only track I enjoyed was the single Love Lockdown, even if it has a similar vibe to the rest of the album."
neg,"One of the worst albums I ever heard, I honestly can't think of a reason for anyone to like it. Kanye can't really sing and the whole album is full with his bad singing mixed with atotune and can't really covers it. 
The subject matter could have been great if he would have done it will. But instead his did it with a bunch of corny lines that sounds like a 12 years old that thinks he will never love again after a break up. 
Even the production, something I thought I would never have to complain about in a Kanye album, was very simple and the electronic sound was not done well"
neg,"Again Rihanna tries to do something mature. However, she can't do something good. It's sad that she always has huge hits. Work is one of the most ridiculous song ever. Shame on her."
neg,"The band?s debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was hardly the brand of Progressive Metal they would have made in the future: instead, it seems like a complicated Obituary worship, complete with omniscient low guitar riffing (mostly standard, at times Drop D), extreme vocals and plenty of ?groovy? or ?funky? moments alternated with more frenetic ones, all tied up by melodic sections with soulful vocals. With the exception of the rock ballad ?Warmness of the Soul? and the interlude, the record follows this monochromatic route from beginning to end. The problem is that, even though if the band could write hooks, they couldn?t make them effective, due to the schizophrenic songwriting, which makes one recall Slipknot with a different tuning. ?Streets? seems like a Bad Religion outtake, while ?Shattered by Broken Dreams? is supposed to be the ?triumphant closer?, but it?s anything except that. M. Shadows? vocals were either amateurish screaming or incorrect and dumb clean tone that hampered the songs. The only thing that they could use aptly was their technical ability, which they started to exploit better on later albums."
neg,"Hail to the King feels less creative and less well written than any of their previous work, and sometimes has questionable moments, mostly regarding songs that are eerily similar to popular hard rock and metal tracks from other artists, but the album overall is a collection of addictive songs and powerful tracks that will be stuck in your head for a while after a few listens."
neg,Rihanna really tried with this one. The vocals have improved but the music is seriously lacking something. The highlight of this album is Needed Me which is actually one of my favourite Rihanna songs now.
neg,"ANTi is very bad. Rihanna disappointed me with this album, I waited both and Rihanna launches an album weak, loaded with auto tune and weak letters."
neg,"Nightmare is another solid effort by A7X, emphasising on the instruments and solos, while having a great set of lyrics too. It is not terribly unique or groundbreaking, but it does present a well crafted set of entertainment. The track that stands out to me is the emotionally driven ballad, So Far Away, a hard hitting track tat shows that A7x can pull your hear. There is catchiness, and it works well with most of the songs here. Special? Not really. Solid? A big yes."
neg,"There is nothing new about this. Yes, her vocals are better but the songs and the lead single are not original at all. I was expecting for a more mature side of rihanna but im feeling really disappointed"
neg,With this album Rihanna again tries very hard to be something she is not which is a serious artist. She had bad single after bad single until she again ran to Drake to get her obviously payola radio play. The vocals are the worse I have heard from her and the transitions between songs don't make since. At almost 30 the good girl gone bad stage is getting boring and stale.
neg,There are only a few songs that show an improvement from rihanna's last albums. The rest of the album seems like a bunch of demos from her previews releases
neg,"This was some garbage, some of these songs (like ""Woo"") sound like striaght up Days Before Rodeo Rejects, yes pun intended. Then the rest of it sounds like some uninspired pop shit and the melodies are so basic."
neg,"I'd give this a album a 3. One for Desperado, two for Love on the Brain. Not crazy about the rest of it. Though I do believe it could potentially lead to Rihanna being taken more seriously as an artist."
neg,"""ANTI"" is one of Rihanna's worst albums. It's very boring and being realistic only around four songs are good. ""Higher"" is terrible, it showcases how truly bad Rihanna's vocals are, it sounds like an incomplete work and ot will even sound worse live. ""Woo"" is the epitome of garbage, what the hell is that? Did she just put random studio sounds + a pile of trash in a blender and that was the result? Disappointing. She needed 39 co-writers to craft the album, she really tried to make a good work but failed miserably. I guess this is what happens when you let talentless people have creative control over music. Even Lady Gaga's latest critically-panned pop release ""ARTPOP"" is indeed 3x better than ""ANTI"", whereas single songs from albums like Taylor Swift's ""1989"" ans Beyonc‚'s self-titled are better than this poor Rih release in full. It's sad. Rihanna should just stick to modeling and leave the music industry for REAL artists. "
pos,I love this album! Harry's 1st album will be amazing! The songs are fun and enjoyable Buy this album!
neg,"These guys excel at the complex, pummeling Eighties-metal moves that first came into circulation when they were in diapers. ""Critical Acclaim"" is a barnburner built around a half-dozen or so rather dope riffs. Problem is, there's not much else here beyond the deft instrumental assault: The tunes ? or at least whatever M. Shadows feels like bellowing ? sound like the kind of lame, nu-metal angst-mongering that dominated the radio in the late Nineties."
neg,"Aside from maintaining a constant flow of clever witticisms and humouring the odd rock band when they decide to give themed titles to each of the songs on a CD (or group of CDs) and pass it off as a concept, musical journalism is a pretty simple occupation. You listen to the record, identify the artist?s strengths and weaknesses and, based on how well they play to their own strengths, you give them a rating. And then you double it. It?s pretty much the same story on the artist?s end- their ability to play to their strengths at any given time (and to develop more in between) largely determines their success as musicians. Ryan Adams is notoriously bad at this; he has no concept of quality control. Butch Walker is notoriously exempt; he has no weaknesses, and he?s a wonderful, wonderful man. Avenged Sevenfold have played this game quite well to date; one gets the impression had they played the cock rock card a couple of years earlier, they?d have fallen flat on their collective face. City of Evil was well-timed and well-executed. Their latest foray into Axl Rose-itude, on the other hand, is bad, bad form.

Just as the lack of restraint of Rose?s artist ego led to some of rock?s most spectacularly unironic Spinal Tap moments in Use Your Illusion II, and the calamitous ?My World,? the eight-minute Mike Patton-raping-Danny Elfman-at-the-bus-stop circus opera ?A Little Piece of Heaven? is what you get from Synyster Gates when he no longer has a critical audience to justify himself to. Which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it! Avenged Sevenfold suffers two-fold from a dearth of genuinely good musical ideas- the infectious vocal melodies which underpin ?Bat Country? and ?Sidewinder? or the dynamic interlocking guitar lines of the latter and ?Beast of the Harlot?- and a total absence of the critical faculties which should have allowed a small orchestral ensemble go hungry rather than become party to the madness of ?A Little Piece of Heaven.? There are good ideas buried within the track and the musicianship is superb, albeit with the exception of the band members, but vocalist M. Shadows possesses none of the authority or basic ability to make a track of this magnitude work. It?s great that people are paying monks to sing, but in this case transcribing manuscripts by hand really is the more productive chore.

The one check in ?A Little Piece of Heaven??s plus column is the fact that it?s set the bar so high that nothing else on the album can quite live up to it. ?Dear God?- or ?Seize The Day (Nashville Remix)? to you and me- makes its case with lazy slide guitar. Not even Shadows? triumphant exclamation that he showers ?every day? can save ?Unbound The Wild Ride? from Muse-inspired mediocrity, while the lengthy passages of agonised moaning and mournful quartet strings hammer home the apparent tedium of the ?Afterlife? all too effectively. On the positive side, the group?s pop instincts are still partly intact. ?Critical Acclaim? runs longer than it needs to (like many of the album?s ten tracks) but at least the group sound like they know what they?re doing. Gates and Zacky Vengeance are comfortable enough to recycle the chunky, Dimebag-style guitar riff for the entire song and for a few brief moments, alongside the frenetically paced ?Almost Easy,? the pair actually approach consistency and- dare I say it""- good taste. Such moments are few and far between beyond the nine-minute mark. Thank goodness for good graces, though, the two tracks are neatly positioned at the front of the record for ease of stopability.
"
pos,"Avenged Sevenfold's first two albums had a clear influence from heavy metal, but the California combo also freely incorporated emo, screamo, and post-hardcore elements. The mixing and matching meant 2003's Waking the Fallen had as many sighing harmonies as it did harmonized guitar freakouts. And yet City of Evil, the band's third record and Warner debut, is absolutely rife with the imagery and pacing of classic metal. Look at that artwork. It features a skeletal swordsman flying a steed with steaming nostrils over the urban inferno of the title; tattoos, demons, and a skull with flapping wings adorn the lyric book. The New Wave of British Heavy Metal influence is immediate and prevalent, from the maniacally rippling percussion throughout to the triumphantly whining lead guitars in the chorus of ""Blinded in Chains,"" or the soaring melody in ""Burn It Down"" that meets its match in Metallica-styled verses. The downshifts into guttural roars are largely gone, replaced by better-integrated atmospheric stretches or the tighter songcraft of a track like ""Bat Country,"" which intersects punk and pop influences in a manner similar to My Chemical Romance. At over seven minutes, ""Wicked End"" is a late-album standout. Vocalist M. Shadows rips through couplets like ""We've grown in numbers, six hundred sixty-six/War breaks, a sign of the end, eternally expelled/Look to the sky for knowledge, the stars align tonight,"" guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance trade off blistering solos, and there's a full choral interlude in the center, complete with an angelic host and sighing cellos. Which is all totally metal, and refreshingly unmarred by attempts to fit too many jumbled genres in. City of Evil's ballads are a little trite, and even its double-bass raging doesn't necessarily break new ground. But Avenged Sevenfold gets all the pieces right, and sound like they're having more fun here than in the scattershot approach of the first couple records."
neg,"The release of Adele Adkins' debut album seems less like a launch than a coronation. Not content with anointing her the BBC's Sound of 2008, industry pundits seem to have invented a Brit, the Critics' Choice award, solely for her benefit. God knows the business needs a hit, but the 19-year-old Brit School graduate may have been saddled with more expectation than she can comfortably bear. The Amy Winehouse comparisons are as misleading as they are predictable. There is scant emotional heft behind Adele's prodigiously rich voice, little bite to her songwriting. Though the supple grooves and sumptuous strings of Tired and Cold Shoulder draw out her sly charisma, too many self-conscious ballads underline the difference between soul, which can shake you into feeling something new, and MOR, which merely soothes and affirms. Adele's success appears preordained regardless, but next to Back to Black's Tanqueray-strength heartache, 19 is more of an alcopop."
neg,"Same old rihanna, with her same old poor beats and lyrics songs. She has created a big hype about this album but the result is not good, actually its terribl"
neg,"A messy array of experimental sounds that do not conform to a single thought or emotion. Though Rihanna tries to come off as a serious artist, her thoughtfulness is lacking and she should stick to lyrics of her past that provide relatable insight and thought, instead of trying to come off as some sort of stylish hipster.
Can anyone remember a time when the musical landscape wasn't dominated by young women, an era that pre-dates the Lilys and Amys, the Corinnes and Josses, the Kates and the Katies, the KTs and the MIAs, the Duffys as well as the Didos all clamouring for our attention? There should be a slogan for this, although that slogan probably shouldn't be 'girl power!'
In the really distant past, Annie Lennox used to win the British Female Solo Artist gong at the Brit Awards every year because there were so few plausible alternatives. Now there's another one along every other minute, although inasmuch as this is a competition, Adele really might be the best of the bunch. First picked as one to watch in this magazine exactly 12 months ago, along with Kate Nash (who had the good grace actually to release her album in 2007), Adele could have since then papered her bedroom with all the hype; next month she plays at the Brits as winner of a newly created Critics' Choice Award which aims to set the tills of Tesco ringing to new talent.
Like Nash, Adele (Adkins) went to the Brit School and like her has that glottal stop down to a T, which is no easy feat; she runs in the same loose pack as the likes of Jack Penate and first released 'Hometown Glory' through Jamie T's own label. That song served notice, celebrating life in London - born in Tottenham, she was brought up in Brixton - in a way more arresting than her eager-to-please peers:
'I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque/ I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades,' she sang, before taking an unexpected detour: 'I like it in the city when two worlds collide/ You get the people and the government, everybody taking different sides.'
The way she stretched the vowels, her wonderful soulful phrasing, the sheer unadulterated pleasure of her voice, stood out all the more; little doubt that she's a rare singer, which another track first available on her MySpace site, 'Daydreamer', confirmed. Rather than the piano for accompaniment, here she played her guitar, casting a dreamy spell. Very Joni Mitchell of N17.
Those two songs (in only slightly embellished form) bookend 19, a title which might possibly be felt as a sly reference to Simon Fuller and the mogul's company of that name, the force behind the Spice Girls and Pop Idol - 'it all comes from impersonating the Spice Girls and Gabrielle,' Adele has said; and so a dig at the whole Brit and Brits business and the implied slick artificiality. But of course, it really refers to her age and so impresses us with her artistic maturity. The rest of the record is, simply, grown-up stuff: whether the simple, finger-popping jazz of 'My Same', the gorgeous balladry of the more epic 'Melt My Heart to Stone', or the heart-stopping new single 'Chasing Pavements', which starts out sounding almost like vintage Portishead before yet more soaring strings take it somewhere less icy.
The one bum note might have been her cover of Bob Dylan's 'Make You Feel My Love', a song that has suffered terrible indignities in the hands of Garth Brooks and Kelly Clarkson previously; but she summons a passion that its croaking author could only envy.
Of course, 'mature' might be a synonym for 'boring', but this is also a perfectly paced record - not one to dissect for the MP3 player - and there are enough contemporary notes struck in the production to make it feel anything but retro. Credit to the likes of seasoned songwriter and producer Eg White, Arctic Monkey man Jim Abbiss and those at XL (otherwise home to the White Stripes and Dizzee Rascal) who have been quietly working with her, nurturing this outstanding debut.
As the last bars fade, however, what stays in the memory is a feeling for Adele's own temperament. Rather than screaming for attention, there's an artistically focused stillness at the centre of so many of these bruising love songs. Forget her peers or even ex-Eurythmics - think Dusty or Aretha, albeit of SW2, instead. 19 has been on constant repeat for several weeks now and will be, I suspect, for the rest of the year to come.

pos,"Well, it was bound to happen; all these hardcore bands running around dressed like glam rockers sans the teased hair had to inevitably lead to a return to the music that spawned that same fashion. Until now, the bands have sounded like short-haired mosh-metal, but the clothing has been decidedly glam. Certainly, the hardcore scene of the past was rife with machismo and the violent crews and straight edge riots did nothing but encourage the testostorone-fueled antics of the more fanatical members of the scene. But at some point, the tide began to turn. Suddenly a vibrant and vital music scene that had been hijacked by the worst stereotype of jock swung to the opposite extreme; it became effeminate, delicate even. 

Relegated to the memories of older scenesters were the memories of kids in fake furs being pummmeled at Earth Crisis shows; instead, the faux fur would emerge as a symbol of the most forward-thinking fashionista. The natural consequence of this? Avenged Sevenfold and their City Of Evil. 

I suppose what I'm saying is that you can't really fault Avenged Sevenfold for their chosen genre of music. The kids wanted to look like glam rock; they wanted the major labels, the cash and teenaged groupies of glam rock. Eventually someone was bound to put two-and-two together and ask why they were bothering with this whole hardcore thing when they could just save time by singing like Guns'n'Roses and playing like Guns'n'Roses. And the ""Guns'n'Roses-core"" of Avenged Sevenfold is not ironic; in interviews they speak lividly of ""markets"" and focused demographics; undoubtedly, they will be tracking their soundscan numbers from the luxury of a plush, major label bus as they make their rounds to the Warped Tour, playing to kids who weren't old enough to remember Axl Rose. No, Avenged Sevenfold has fully immersed themselves in the heavy fuckin' metal of 1985, and expect all the trapping that it could bring. 

Accordingly, while the failed auteur of Chinese Democracy is certainly the first name that springs to mind when listening to City Of Evil, comparisons to Alice In Chains' decidedly more metal Facelift are also deserved. Vocalist M. Shadows sounds eerily like the late Layne Staley, particularly on ""Burn It Down."" Almost completely boiled away are the Thrice comparions which dogged their first full-length, replaced instead with what I imagine will be endless kudos from the British metal press; the band conjures up Iron Maiden far more than Bad Religion this time around. Harmonized leads, endless soloing and cover art which could have been borrowed from a long forgotten 80's hair metal album; it's all here. 

Besides the overwhelming power metal cheese of the band -- which may or may not be a strike against them depending on your perspective -- there are some decidedly more objective problems with the record; the first is certainly the overwhelming length of many of the songs. While it is possible to write an effective song at longer than five minutes, it is remarkably difficult for Avenged Sevenfold to do so while mantaining any semblance of a theme and still keeping things interesting; far too much of the material on the record stretches far beyond any measure of patience, often reusing bridges, choruses and ideas haphazardly. 

The frustratingly catchy ""Blinded in Chains"" starts strong, but falters simply because of the sheer endurance as the song seemingly repeats itself for about three minutes before finally finding its footing. At more than six minutes, one wonders why the band didn't consider ending the song about halfway through; instead, a catchy opening is forgotten as they trudge aimlessly through the song. 

""Seize The Day"" is clearly the band's most obvious scrounging of Guns'n'Roses, complete with a nearly-plagarized melody layered over a piano and a guitarist soloing in what I imagine is a top hat. The seven-minute ""Sidewinder"" begins with a solid, shredding riff, but the eventual caterwaulling vocals which accompany it deaden any of it's power. 

Avenged Sevenfold has pulled off a remarkable transformation over their few records; gone almost entirely is the screaming, the growling and other vocal cartwheels at which M.Shadows admittedly excelled; in its place are songs that place a remarkable amount of pressure on his singing voice. At times, he succeeds, and at other times his Axl Rose imitation falls short. The band has strayed so far from hardcore that it becomes incredibly difficult to rate it; as a hardcore, punk or even metalcore record, it is a decided failure, choosing all the self-indulgent noodling that inspired bands like the Ramones and Minor Threat to do something different. On the other hand, as a attempt at power metal, it succeeds on nearly all counts. All the elements of the genre are in place and done surprisingly well.

pos,"Though they dress like goth punks and are currently one of the hottest acts on the Warped Tour, Avenged Sevenfold have evolved since 2001 from a hardcore-influenced screamo outfit into straight-up metalheads. Fiery twin-guitar assaults and complex rhythms dominate their major-label debut, but where City of Evil marks a departure from Avenged?s past is its vocals: Frontman M. Shadows can now properly be called a singer, having honed his pipes with a voice coach who previously trained Axl Rose and Chris Cornell. Though Shadows occasionally sounds like both those guys, there?s no mistaking this band?s love for the gloom, doom and mythology of classic British metal acts. Peep the horseback skeleton warrior on the album cover and see if you don?t think it?s an obvious homage to Judas Priest artwork of yore."

Besides having dropped their third singles released in 2015, Rihanna took 3 years to release an album that could only have been recorded and released in one year! I am frustrated and disappointed! But is that saying: We will do what?"
neg,"This album is awful. It's just terrible pop music that doesn't deserve a good score at all. It's literally Twitter meme music, which is bad. "
neg,"I could give her credit for trying, but it's just not happening. She simply don't have the voice for strong vocals as required in songs like ""Higher"", so she sounds strained and... bad. ""Work"" is a bad ""try-to-hit"" song, giving bad name to old collabs with Drake like gems ""What's My Name"" and ""Take Care"". Also, it feels like all this time waiting had nothing to do with the production: ""Same Ol' Mistakes"" sounds EXACTLY like the original one from Tame Impala. Overall, this album does not stand for what we know she can do outside the generic pop, like ""Lost In Paradise"" or ""Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary""."
neg,Album feels uncohesive and strained. For the four year wait and antidairy we had to endure the album seems to be a huge let down. Rihanna slurs her words and seems not to care about her music but at the same time to parade it as the best album ever. I don't see it
pos,"Fast guitar solos. Skillful double bass drumming. Heavy riffs. All of those are terms that apply to heavy metal music. Avenged Sevenfold?s third album, City of Evil has all of those things. So why do some people insist upon saying that Avenged Sevenfold is not a metal band"" We all know the story. Vocalist Matt Shadows messed up his voice by screaming incorrectly on their first two albums, so he was forced to use clean vocals throughout all of City of Evil. Avenged lost a lot of old fans and gained a lot of new ones with the release of this album. It?s catchy enough to appeal to people that aren?t into metal, yet it still has all of the elements that metal fans love. Some people say they?re sellouts; others have touted them as the saviors of metal. I don?t agree with either of those. But one thing?s for sure: Avenged Sevenfold is metal.

I?m going to come right out and say that the vocals on Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet were awful. The clean singing was just alright, but the screaming was terrible. My vocal chords hurt just listening to it. So I think I?m justified in saying that Shadows? surgery was the best thing that ever happened to the band. Instead of barely understandable pig squealing, we get straightforward rock/metal vocals. Although the vocals are a huge step up from their previous efforts, I still have some complaints about them. Shadows? screaming was no doubt painful to listen to, but some of the vocals on here are painful as well, just in a different way. On some songs, when Shadows hits a high note, it makes me wince just like his screaming did. Also, his voice tends to comes off as whiny here and there, most notably on Seize the Day. Fortunately, whiny singing is the exception and not the rule for this album. 

Additionally, I felt that they tampered too much with Shadows? vocals. Overdubbing is prominent throughout the whole CD, and it can get annoying after a while. I can understand that they wanted to take attention away from the lack of screaming by making his new voice stand out as much as possible, but at times it feels like they messed with it too much. The most obvious example of this is in Beast and the Harlot. Every vocal line is overdubbed, and although it sounds good, I think they should have laid off on the overdubs a little bit to let Shadows? natural voice be heard more. When his voice isn?t being hampered down by overdubs and whininess, Shadows? voice is incredibly strong. His lyrics aren?t too shabby either. Their first two albums contained average metalcore lyrics, but Shadows? lyrics on City of Evil are equal parts epic and powerful. Whether the subject matter is the apocalypse (Beast and the Harlot and The Wicked End), revenge (Burn It Down and Strength of the World), or a pseudo-political commentary (Blinded in Chains), Shadows shows some immense writing skill that just wasn?t present on their first two albums. 

Although I don?t like their previous efforts that much at all, one thing that has always impressed me about Avenged Sevenfold?s music is their ?structureless song structures.? Every song on this album is longer than four and a half minutes, yet A7X manages to keep them fresh by throwing in multiple bridges, variations on verses and choruses, and numerous guitar solos. A verse-chorus-bridge-chorus formula is rarely ever used. The increase in musicianship is even more impressive than the change in vocals. A7X compensated for the lack of screaming with their instruments, most notably the guitars. The solos on Waking the Fallen were good, but Synyster and Zacky took it to a whole new level on this album. You can find everything on this album from sweep picking (The Wicked End, Seize the Day) to an acoustic solo (Sidewinder, courtesy of Synyster?s father), to harmonizing (M.I.A., Bat Country), to all out shredding (Beast and the Harlot). They don?t disappoint with their riffs either; check out Strength of the World and Betrayed. The Rev is a pretty talented drummer, and he likes his double bass pedal. His standout song is Blinded in Chains, where he goes crazy with some sweet fills and fast feet. Johnny Christ, sadly, is not heard for most of the album. He?s a pretty skilled bass player, and they should give him more room to show off his talent. He isn?t invisible though; he can be heard playing some nice riffs on songs such as Blinded in Chains and Trashed and Scattered.

pos,"When it comes to commercially successful hard rock/metal bands, Avenged Sevenfold are near the top of the list. Their last four albums have gone gold, selling at least 500,000 copies, with City Of Evilhitting the platinum mark of a million copies. They?ve also had a plethora of hit singles, from ?Bat County? to ?Almost Evil? to ?So Far Away.? That will all continue or grow even bigger with their latest effort Hail To The King.
The title track has already hit number one on the rock chart, with many other potential hit singles to come. A7X have always positioned themselves, to the anger of many, as the heir apparent to legendary bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden. They have never been afraid to say what they think, drawing a lot of controversy with their antics, especially in their younger days.
Age and tragedy have matured the band somewhat since those days, and musically they have certainly refined and improved their sound. Hail To The King is the culmination of nearly 15 years of work, and while not elder statesmen, Avenged Sevenfold seem to be hitting their musical prime with their sixth full-length.
While their previous albums all had strong moments, they were offset by periodic inconsistency. This time around, they have minimized that while strengthening their songwriting. Guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance have especially upped their game. New drummer Arin Illejay has some huge shoes to fill, and holds down the fort nicely.
?Shepherd of Fire? sets the tone for the album, with the opening track showcasing that guitar work, but also more sophisticated arrangements and dynamics with plenty of melody. Avenged Sevenfold have always worn their influences on their sleeve, and on Hail To The King you?ll hear elements of bands ranging from Metallica to Maiden to Zeppelin to Guns ?N Roses. Some of those influences are subtle, others are not.
?This Means War? is eerily similar to Metallica?s ?Sad But True.? If you?re going to emulate a song, that?s a good one to pick, and Avenged Sevenfold add a few twists and turns of their own. They also pay homage to Megadeth?s ?Symphony Of Destruction? on the track ?Heretic.?
?Requiem? introduces some symphonic and cinematic elements, a nice dose of diversity in the middle of the album. And instead of trying to drag in out into an 8 minute epic, they smartly keep it a streamlined four minutes and change. M. Shadows is front and center on the power ballad ?Crimson Day,? displaying a nice range of textures and styles.
The latter part of the album loses no momentum at all, with ?Coming Home? one of the strongest songs on the album and the closer ?Acid Rain? is a very well-done mid-tempo ballad with a lot of atmosphere and another good performance from Shadows.
While still a polarizing band, with Hail To The King Avenged Sevenfold have made an album fans of classic bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden can appreciate, but with a modern enough sound that their existing fan base will also embrace it. The debate will continue about their historic place in the hard rock/metal pantheon, but in 2013 there?s no disputing Avenged Sevenfold?s place among the elite.

"
pos,"Throughout the course of Avenged Sevenfold?s last few albums, they have evolved into a more hard-rock-oriented wrecking crew while still retaining a strong tie to their metallic roots. With an evident desire to write the biggest music imaginable, they have upped the game with every release, and Hail To The King is an epic album indeed?and possibly their best to date. Yes, at times it sounds like a virtual rewrite of Metallica?s Black Album, at others Use Your Illusion-era Guns N? Roses, but this just channels into it being a great soundtrack for whipping arena audiences into a frenzy.
The Metallica influence is evident from the off, ?Shepherd Of Fire? coming in with a dirty riff over a stomping beat, and if James Hetfield?s vocals let rip rather than M. Shadows?, it would not be a surprise. Still, it has the A7X stamp on it, and this is just as prevalent on the titanic ?This Means War? and the mean grooves of ?Heretic.? Likewise, the energetic romps ?Doing Time? and ?Coming Home? crackle with swaggering cool, while A7X launch into full-blown power-ballad territory with ?Crimson Day,? which just barely stays on the right side of cheesy. Enlivening every track are the lithe leads and solos of Synsyter Gates. Adding texture and dynamism in a manner that breathes extra life into them, the guitarist really is the heart of the band, and air guitar fanatics are in danger of developing RSI in trying to keep up with him.
Of course, it would not be an Avenged Sevenfold record without a whole lot of melodrama, and they haven?t skimped. Backing up their chunky riffs on the aforementioned ?Shepherd Of Fire? and ?Planets? with what sounds like Satan?s own horn section does not make for a subtle effect; neither does Shadows? demonic cackle kicking off ?Doing Time.? However, they reserve the lion?s share for the frankly berserk ?Requiem,? which features a rather agitated sounding choir, massive orchestral arrangements and a spoken word section, and somehow they bring all this together in a winning fashion. Compared to this, the tragedy-tinged closing waltz of ?Acid Rain? falls a little flat, Shadows? voice at the forefront as the orchestra and guitars swirl around behind him, ending the record on a reflective but somewhat unexciting note.
That this is by far the band?s most commercial outing will send purists running for the hills, but then most of them may well have jumped ship a while ago. However, those who fell in love with 2007?s self-titled release or 2010?s Nightmare will find plenty to fall for here, too. It?s a big, shiny, shamelessly indulgent affair played by talented musicians, and when it comes down to it, it?s just a lot of fun. Switching your brain off before approaching is optional, but it can?t hurt.

pos,"The one metal band of their generation routinely touted as potential festival headliners, Avenged Sevenfold have never been short of ambition or tunes, and yet their last two albums were undeniably patchy and unfocused. Seemingly the Californians' first wholesale bid for rock immortality, Hail to the King makes no apologies for its strident saluting of metal's established legends, with several eerily familiar riffs and dynamic moments that Metallica's lawyers might consider a little cheeky. However, shorn of its predecessors' sonic clutter and over-egged arrangements, Hail swiftly turns its old-school preoccupation into a virtue via a stirring, muscular batch of songs. Stripped down to a core of thudding Sabbath-like grooves and brash, spiky vocal refrains, Avenged now sound every bit as vital and imperious as the bands they aspire to emulate. Incalculable hugeness seems pleasingly inevitable."
pos,"To watch Avenged Sevenfold over the years, it's been fairly clear that this is a band with a plan. With each of their first five albums, A7X steadily evolved, albeit in varying degrees. Tragically, their ascension was harrowingly derailed in December 2009 with the death of their drummer, Jimmy ?The Rev? Sullivan.
The Rev wasn't just their drummer. He was a highly charismatic and creative force within the band. Looking back, it's hard to think of how they could have dealt with it any better. The band had already started work on what would become the No. 1 album 'Nightmare.' And they also seemed to understand that their band was more than just the sum of its parts. So they recruited then-Dream Theater ace Mike Portnoy (who was also one of the Rev?s heroes) to play on the record and then also to tour behind it once was released.
And they did more than survive. They thrived.
The band's new release, 'Hail to the King,' represents the first full creative effort of the post-Rev era. It also is a watermark moment in this band's history. With this album, Avenged Sevenfold have graduated to a new, impressive level. It would be easy to say that they are older and more mature, but that would be a lazy observation. Instead, the band seems to have consciously shed its metalcore skin and acknowledged that they are ready to take over the mantle of the Next Great American Metal Band.
You know who these guys listened to growing up simply by looking at the t-shirts they wear on and off stage: Metallica, Zeppelin, GN'R, Motorhead, AC/DC, Pantera and so on. They've been on a steady course to one day create the music that harkens back to these classic metal artists while also creating something uniquely A7X. With 'Hail to the King,' that concept has been realized. And it is a slam-dunk.
This album thunders and cracks with much musical lightning, as the four original members -- M. Shadows, Synyster Gates, Zacky Vengeance and Johnny Christ -- are joined on drums by Arin Ilejay (who has been with the band since the departure of Mike Portnoy after the first several legs of the 'Nightmare' tour). Ilejay does a competent job of holding down the beats, but this record is more about the evolution and growth of the four guys we've known since the late 1990s. The core.
This epic collection kicks off with 'Shepherd of Fire,' a Metallica-esque stomper that sets the tone for what follows: crunchy, arena-ready, groove-laden metal that while paying a certain kind of homage to the classics, is also pure Avenged Sevenfold. The trademark intertwined solos between Gates and Vengeance have become sexier and sturdier over the years; effortless if you watch them live, but clearly are the product of much focus and ability. On this record, the twin-axe attack is in exceptional form, with Gates in particular playing some exquisite solos.
Avenged have always distinguished themselves by treating melody with the same respect that they do sing-along choruses and fist pumping, head-banging chord structures. It occasionally gets them tagged with the ?commercial? moniker but so what? Ask Led Zeppelin and Metallica if they mind having hit records and we all know what the answer will be.
The title track (which is already a No. 1 rock hit), along with the songs 'Heretic,' 'This Means War' and 'Coming Home,' all feature super-catchy constructions while never sacrificing the drama or ferocity.
There are also some strings, a satanic-sounding horn section and some spoken word portions that could be flagged as being a bit indulgent or forced, but in the grand scheme of this crafty and polished collection, those elements all sort of make sense. It almost comes naturally on an album that reflects so many metallic influences and disciplines.
Another component that sets this record apart from anything else this band done is the vocal quality and performance of Shadows. His command and control seem at an all-time high. Whether he is soaring in the heavy, military-paced 'Requiem' (which features an operatic Latin choir intro) or doing a more tender take on a ballad like 'Crimson Day' or 'Acid Rain,' he demonstrates a range not always found in most metal frontmen. But this is not most metal bands. This is Avenged Sevenfold and with 'Hail to the King' they have achieved something quite special. They have managed to grow and evolve without losing any of their fire, edge or intensity. A7X have shaped and crafted a modern metal classic that reflects the past while very much embracing the present.
A few years ago, it was hard to predict the future of this band. But 'Hail to the King' sends a clear message: Avenged Sevenfold are here to stay!

"
pos,"It's an album on which the Californian heavy metal band - who this week were announced as one of the headliners of Australia's Soundwave festival - finally get serious following a run of mostly patchy records where they seemed unsure about who and what they were.
On Hail to the King they up the grunt and brutality factor, and give it a staunch melodic metal and classic rock edge. Though it initially comes across as a slick heavy-metal album, the impressive scale of the record is revealed with centrepiece Requiem, with its grand, eerie Nosferatu-like orchestral and choral arrangements.
And there are other towering epics here, too. Coming Home powers and pummels on effortlessly and This Means War is a bruising cross between classic Metallica and Avenged Sevenfold's own penchant for fist-pumping anthems.
What also lends the band a wider appeal than just being a heavy metal band is singer M. Shadows, who's a mix of Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden and David Draiman of Disturbed, but with hints of former Stone Temple Pilots' vocalist Scott Weiland (especially on the raging Sunset Strip rock of Doing Time).
Crimson Day is the album's snooziest moment, where you wish they'd just get on with the grunty stuff - which, thankfully, they do with the jagged guitars and bottom end rumble of Heretic.
"
pos,"The bowels of hell used to disgorge metal messiahs like Avenged Sevenfold all the time. But these days, the band?s vision of mainstream headbanging is as adorably quaint as a glow-in-the-dark Iron Maiden poster in a rec room that Dad converted to storage space in 1994. Fusing elements of goth, screamo and what was once called nu metal with the late-Seventies new wave of British metal-metal, their sixth LP piles clarion solos atop clean, sludge-chug riffs. Vocalist M. Shadows nearly busts a kidney calling down a Satan-y apocalypse on ?Shepherd of Fire,? and the ballad-ªstorm ?Acid Rain? is Romeo and Juliet by way of Queensr˜che. Suicide: still a solution after all these years.
 
 
 
Adele Adkins is still a young woman -- just 27, which is to say two years older than the number on the cover of her third album. But she?s determined to sound as old as the hills. The love-wracked ing‚nue of 21 has given way to a lioness-in-winter, shouldering a lifetime?s worth of world-weariness and regret. The song titles tell the story: ?When We Were Young,? ?Water Under the Bridge,? ?Million Years Ago.?
In one song, Adele casts herself as Old Woman River, reaching for a soggy riparian metaphor: ?The reeds are growing out of my fingertips.? Eventually, she pumps up the ennui to Full Gallic. Harmonically and spiritually, ?Million Years Ago? is a cousin to French chanson, with a brooding melody that?s nudged forward by plucked acoustic guitar, and a lyric that sounds like it?s being hissed across a caf‚ table to Jacques Brel: ?I know I?m not the only one/ Who regrets the things she?s done?Life was a party to be thrown/But that was a million years ago.?
These sentiments have a slightly callow ring: a young person?s idea of an old fogey?s ruefulness. But to be fair, pop stars grow up fast and do a lot of living. Over the last five years, Adele has gone from a rising star to world-beater, releasing an album, 21, that?s the closest the music industry may ever again come to Thriller. Also, she had a baby -- a heady experience that can make a person feel like she?s aged decades overnight. In any case, Adele?s elegiac turn makes sense as a career move. From Edith Piaf to Dusty Springfield to Barbra Streisand and beyond, nostalgia has been standard torch singer fodder. If a diva isn?t mooning over lost love, she?s lamenting vanished time.
Adele's '25' Will Ship 3.6 Million in U.S., May Top *NSYNC's Historic Sales Week
Adele certainly has the pipes for the job. 25 is first and foremost a showcase for her titanic voice. The grandeur is announced by the album opener, the global No. 1 ?Hello,? which sets a mood of mournful longing while traveling the heroic power-ballad trajectory, from stately verse to booming chorus to falsetto whoops and back again. Her singing is at its most luminous on ?All I Ask,? co-written and produced by Bruno Mars? Smeezingtons crew, which strips back the instrumentation to piano only, and sets Adele gusting over the octaves.
That song, like nearly everything on 25, pursues a simple strategy: get out of the way. The liner notes reveal a roster of heavy-hitting talent -- Max Martin and Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Ryan Tedder, Danger Mouse, Adele?s longtime sidekick Paul Epworth -- but this is not a producer?s record. The one exception is Epworth?s ?I Miss You,? whose stuttering beat and eerie swirl of backing vocals and effects gesture mildly in the direction of nu-R&B. For the most part, Adele and her collaborators place her burly mid-range front-and-center and keep the ornamentation to a minimum. There are hints of the singer?s soul revivalism in hooting backing vocals and tolling gospel chord progressions. But there is nothing as explicitly old-school as Motown girl group update ?Rolling in the Deep? -- nor anything as gripping.

Looked at from one angle, the Adele aesthetic is perverse -- based, seemingly, on a determination to do the soberest and most uninteresting possible things with an all-world voice. Martin and Shellback?s ?Send My Love (To Your New Lover)? is sprightlier than anything else on 25, but you can sense those Swedish pop wizards straining to keep the song in check, as if too many hooks, too much fun, would be a crime against the brand and a breach of good taste. Adele, after all, is nothing if not tasteful. In everything but vocal prowess, she is aggressively normal. Her lyrics traffic in clich‚s but aren?t recklessly gauche enough to qualify as schlock; her arrangements are huge but tidy, prim. She doesn't have the fearless tackiness of Adult Contemporary stalwarts like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey or, God knows, Streisand. She is, you might say, quite English.
And yet: that voice. On 25, the material is occasionally inspired, sometimes dull, but always serviceable -- and with Adele, that?s enough. Ballads like ?Love in the Dark? and ?Sweetest Devotion? revisit timeworn themes (of heartache and uplift, respectively); but with Adele?s voice swathed in echo, sounding like she?s wailing beneath the vaults of the planet?s most cavernous cathedral, they hit hard. History teaches us that the power to blow back ears is the power to jerk tears -- and that the pop audience craves catharsis even more than it does a hot dance beat. That?s not about to change: there?s every reason to believe it will be true when Adele actually is long in the tooth, and the title of her new album is 78.

pos,"Following the death of Avenged Sevenfold drummer James ?The Reverend? Sullivan in 2009, the band marched on, enlisting the help of Sullivan?s drumming hero, Dream Theater?s Mike Portnoy, for their fifth studio album Nightmare. Luckily, the sound of the band remains unchanged, and as one of the best drummers in the business, Portnoy picks up the reigns and rides the Deathbat's double kick in complete synchronicity with Gates, Christ, and Vengeance. Like their previous outings, the group incorporates a New Wave of British Heavy Metal influence throughout Nightmare while paying tribute to ?80s hair metal with guitar god appeal; but playing retroactive music doesn?t seem to concern them, as long as they play it more skillfully than their forefathers. The group?s influences may be worn on their sleeves, (check out the chugging Metallica ""One"" breakdown in ?Buried Alive,? or the Queensr˜che-style power-ballad ?Victim?), but there is no denying that they have some of the best chops in the metal world. Songs shift from their trademark blistering assault to Black album ballads on a dime; M. Shadowscontinually amazes with his vocal acrobatics, and the opening riff of ""Natural Born Killer"" ramps up to an inhuman speed. ""Save Me"" ends the album as one of their most epic songs to date, in a proper 21 gun salute, as thunderous blasts and guitar divebombs interweave into a melodic, heartfelt ?Tonight we all die young!? outro. It's a fitting tribute for their fallen 28-year-old comrade, and excellent proof of the band's ability. However, as great as Nightmare's finale is, the Alice Cooper-gone-blue ?it?s your fuckin? nightmare!? chorus on the title track is too clich‚ to be excused."
pos," While Avenged Sevenfold have previously been able to overcome their weaknesses, the strongest moments on Nightmare aren't quite good enough to hide its flaws.

If there's a grey area between solid return to form and stagnant mediocrity, this is more or less where Avenged Sevenfold hits the mark with Nightmare. Given the terrible rut the band worked themselves into on their self-titled record and the less than stellar ""Nightmare"" and ""Buried Alive"", previewed in the weeks leading up to the album's release, Nightmare's prospects didn't look good. But then again, even Avenged Sevenfold's good albums have unfortunate moments (the bro-downs in Sounding the Seventh Trumpet's ""Thick and Thin"", the mundane pace in Waking the Fallen's ""Desecrate Through Reverence"", the clumsy songwriting in City of Evil's ""Betrayed""). While they've previously been able to overcome their weaknesses, the strongest moments on Nightmarearen't quite good enough to hide Avenged Sevenfold's flaws. 

Nightmare isn't an easy album to dive into for two major reasons, both of which hold back several otherwise decent tracks. Avenged Sevenfold have always been at their best when they focus on playing infectious melodic metal (or metalcore), particularly through their utilization of Iron Maiden inspired guitar harmonies. The results are predictably less than adept when they get heavier. It's obvious that they love Pantera and Metallica, but the chunky, down-tuned groove riffs sounded terrible in the '90s, and sound terrible in ""Nightmare"", ""Welcome to the Family"", ""Buried Alive"", and especially ""God Hates Us"". It's a problem closely related to Nightmare's other huge issue: the album is too damn long. Or it feels that way at any rate; Nightmare's sixty-six minutes run shorter than both Waking the Fallen and City of Evil, and though the majority of the record's rockers are only around five minutes long, they do not flow as fluidly as they could. With the exception of ""God Hates Us"" and ""Buried Alive"", guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance do transition back into their melodic tendencies in choruses, instrumental breaks, and the like, making for a much more engaging listen. Granted, so long as you can make it through the poor attempts at groove influenced metal, that is. 

""God Hates Us"" aside, the second half of Nightmare is where things get really interesting. Eschewing the sometimes noteworthy, sometimes half-baked metal sound established earlier, Avenged Sevenfold embrace both acoustic pieces and ballads alike. While the band's slower songs are usually hit or miss, ranging from great (""I Won't See You Tonight, Pt 1""), to the mediocre (""Warmness On the Soul""), to flat out awful (""Dear God""), they're excellent this time around. For an album plagued by macho metal posturing, it comes at a key moment. The Alice in Chains influenced ""Tonight the World Dies"" is especially notable, building its foundation on its heat-choked atmosphere rather than instrumental prowess. Between the piano heavy ""Fiction"", dark power-ballad ""Victim"", and stripped down ""So Far Away"", it's a much needed breath of fresh air.

Perhaps the chief reason for Avenged Sevenfold's mini-resurgence is that they're actually inspired again. The most offensive aspect of their self-titled album was that it sounded like they weren't even trying, which was reflected in the record's atrocious output. Nightmare is a completely different offering; even though it still has highly questionable moments, it's obvious that a genuine effort was put in, and that's enough reason to listen. In a way, Nightmare is Avenged Sevenfold's most important record. It's as much closure for the group's surviving members as it is a dedication to The Rev after the drummer's untimely death. In this regard, it's a very respectable record. But at the same time, it just isn't as good as Waking the Fallen, City of Evil, or even Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, and whether it'll maintain the listening power that made those albums so good remains to be seen.
"
pos,"Avenged Sevenfold has crafted a tremendous variation of metalcore, inflecting the traditional metal sound with outrageous bursts of hardcore fury and mesmerizing wails more likely found in the European vein of death metal. These elements together create an amazing but lethal crush on the listener, leaving one breathless after such feats. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet is an exceptional album that finds the group perfecting its own distinct style, and although the bandmembers remain fairly unknown on the metal scene, one could only imagine that this will change rather quickly. Frontman M. Shadows is a force to be reckoned with, as his screams are capable of making blood flow from one's ears, while his singing voice has the ability to feel those vicious wounds. Songs such as ""Darkness Surrounding"" and ""We Come Out at Night"" are excellent metalcore masterpieces, as the vocal harmonies add to these cuts to evolve the songs into fully atmospheric sonic blasts. As the album unfolds, Shadows' singing voice becomes the more dominant style and that is slightly unfortunate; the melodies are given much more intensity when his voice is used to a lesser extent amidst the grating bellows -- yet there is no bad song included on this collection. Musically, the band has seamlessly woven hardcore crunch with heavy metal flair, and never once bogs itself down with too much intricacy. ""Streets"" may surprise some for its punk feel, yet it all makes sense since it's a cover of the Successful Failure song, proving that Avenged Sevenfold could easily outdo many of the gritty punk groups in existence in the 21st century. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet is a magnificent album that is suitable for any fan of metal music, as Avenged Sevenfold has a firm grasp on all that is extreme."
pos,"Mudrock's dry production focuses almost all of Waking the Fallen on Avenged Sevenfold's greatest strength. That, of course, would be performance, and the band delivers with unflagging aggression and precision. Never mind the lyrical ennui or throat-scrape yowling; there's more to this music than generic clich‚. When he wants to, M. Shadows can passionately project in a way that turns even the grim ""Desecrate Through Reverance"" into an almost bouncy little melody. (Incidentally, Reverance? Remenissions? Reverand? Maybe doomsday is around the corner, but isn't there still time to run song titles and soubriquets through a spell check?) And whether attacking a riff in unison or in harmonized parts, the double-threat guitars of Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance do their duty like search-and-destroy commandos -- in and out fast, leaving devastation in their wake. Especially noteworthy -- and note-heavy -- is the guitar solo that blazes through the last moments of ""Second Heartbeat"" and the head-spinning single-stroke virtuosity of the Reverand throughout the album."
pos,"The seventh studio long-player from the veteran California-based metal ensemble, and their first new collection of music to feature ex-Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman behind the kit, The Stagesees Avenged Sevenfold rolling up their sleeves and delivering an ambitious concept LP. Dropped with little to no promotion -- WWE superstar and Fozzy frontman Chris Jericho leaked the album's original title, Voltaic Oceans, via his Instagram account a month prior to the release -- the narrative concerns itself with the Orwellian consequences of a world struggling to adapt to the myriad complexities of artificial intelligence -- there's even a spoken word appearance by celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. Despite some forays into Floyd-ian space rock -- the soloing in the orchestra-driven ""Roman Sky"" is positively Gilmour-esque -- the 11-track set mostly sticks to the kind of propulsive, melodic carnage that fans have come to expect from the group, albeit with a progressive metal twist. Avenged Sevenfoldmay have expanded their sonic horizons, but The Stage is more Operation: Mindcrime-era Queensr˜che than it is Muse, and for all its opining on nanotechnology and interstellar travel, it still feels rooted in heavy metal tradition."
neg,"This album ended how it began ""MESSY"", after three failed first singles, 'work' was born. I was mesmerised, despite it being an extremely lazy song, there was something great about it and it gave me hope for the rest of the album. However, when Anti dropped after the terrible samsung campaign ended, the album had no direction, no point, no meaning. It was just a mix of songs, it almost sounded like a mixtape. Though I do BELIEVE rihanna has tried on this project as her vocals have never sounded better but she's just not an album artist, she is a single artist who should stick to creating pop hits. Hoping to get another GGGB/ LOUD/ album soon"
neg,Commercial bullshit. Nothing like the adult alternative pop classics.
neg,"Weak album in every sense of the word. It's sad, mainly because of all these years of waiting for absolutely nothing. First of all, lyrical composition is forced and sloppy, chiefly as a woman who 'experiences' her own lyrics. The result converges in a painful situation when you don't know if you should feel sorry for her or for yourself. This, with the addition of her voice is something a bit weird, because you can actually feel the quality dissonance in the songs: While she keeps trying to lift all the songs, they just sink her really bad. Music is nothing but a bad joke. The arrangements are poorly designed, they lack strength and the structure is boring all the way. Finally, in almost every song (maybe not 'Hello'), the chorus doesn't help Adele's voice to shine as usual, but the opposite. And better not talk about the codas... Anyway, it's a waste of time, considering that infinite wave of new LPs dropping every day. Pretty bad year for Adele. Good luck for the next time."
neg,"She obviously forgot how to sing... Unfortunately it's a steady decline from her first album. When I first saw ""Chasing Pavements"" on TV I thought wow she's gonna be a great artist but I guess the disappointment continues with every release till I listened to this album ""25"" now I lost all hope. Wish her all the best anyway."
pos,"Straight up? Avenged Sevenfold?s new album is compelling because the SoCal quintet unashamedly continue to embrace their larger-than-life arena-rock ambitions, while genuflecting at the altars of the gods of hard rock and metal before them?on their own terms. While many bands that came up through ?the scene? are now willing to cozy up to radio programmers to play shows where the stage backdrops have more corporate logos than an Indy 500 racecar, The Stage finds A7X looking back and forward to seal their destiny. With a science-fiction undercurrent underpinning the 11 tracks, song lengths that hearken back to old-school Metallica (ca. ?And Justice For All) and all kinds of sonic sorcery (dystopian dialogue, horn sections, tasteful electronics, choirs, codas of acoustic guitars and keyboards, you name it), The Stage makes things really interesting for the band, their fans and long-in-the-tooth metal fans who may have dismissed A7X for some hackneyed reason or another.
Frontman M. Shadows has carved out his own vocal personality somewhere between the rarified altitude of legend-era Geoff Tate and James Hetfield?s populist growl. On ?Sunny Disposition,? he comes off like a chrome-plated desperado (?We?ve been through hell/Sewn up our eyes/Found fuel in meds?) going from shots-and-smokes gruffness to a hard staccato most rappers would kill for. The twin-guitar team of Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance maintain their roles as bona fide guitar heroes, bringing both the shred (?Fermi Paradox?) and the finesse (the acoustic coda at the end of the near-nine-minute title track) in equal parts. New drummer Brooks Wackerman brings back all the technicality and fire that was missing rhythmically on Hail To The King. His phrasing on the amazing ?Creating God? is the perfect launchpad for Shadows, Gates, Vengeance and bassist Johnny Christ to power through. Ditto on ?Simulation,? where the drummer navigates the proceedings deftly from tribal rolls to forceful hitting worthy of a hedge-fund manager?s face. You may have heard Wackerman in Bad Religion; you haven?t heard him like this.
A7X are stridently confident in who they are as songwriters and musicians, otherwise they wouldn?t have dared to attempt their most ambitious gesture yet: The near-16-minute closing track ?Exist? is a prog-shred opus, starting as a massive fretboard workout before downshifting into a lush, warm atmosphere (ca. late-era Pink Floyd), before the whole enterprise downshifts into a reflective meditation on the state of the world, only to be accelerated once again with the guitarists, Wackerman and guest keyboardist Jason Freese offering a majestic, celebratory workout while acclaimed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson offers philosophical insight to the plight of mankind and the universe as we (don?t) know it.
More so than any of their previous releases, The Stage finds A7X evolving at a rate that is natural and organic. They didn?t call in EDM producers to provide awkward rinse-and-drop dynamics, superstar MC?s to spitball lyrics or make any leftfield turns into unnecessary genres. What they did do was stick to their guns. And as the old guard of arena-filling hard rockers begin to diminish (physically, artistically), it?s good to know there?s someone dedicated to keeping the bar high.

"
neg,"Awful, The worst album i've heard in a long time. Vocals are bad, Lyrics pathetic, the same repetitive garbage throughout the whole album."
neg,"I freely admit to being completely disappointed with ""25"". Adele has an huge issue with frontloading all three records with absolutely KILLER singles, then padding out the rest of with bloated, over-long pastiches of sound that somehow equate power and scope with emotion. While there's a lot of emotion here (all of it, mind, overdone, overstated and overripe), she doesn't latch on and make the listener FEEL what she's saying. For the most part, she's trying too hard. And when she's NOT trying too hard, she's not trying hard enough. So for the better part of the record, she's indulging herself in a tail chase. Don't misunderstand; I could handle all the back-and-forth if (IF) the rest of the music was any good, but outside of ""Hello"" (fantastic and eminently singable, should you choose to baptize your vocal chords in fire) ""When We Were Young"" (decent, but tends to wear out due to the plodding), and ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"" (a blistering piece of passive-aggressive bluster that, while musically excellent, is lyrically trite enough to make Kelly Clarkson roll her eyes), she simply doesn't pack the wallop here that made ""21"" so listenable, even with all its flaws. 

Plus, she needs to get away from having a different person produce each song. The idea of having different people helm each track is interesting in THEORY, but an abject failure in practice, since this is music that only exists on the surface, and a good portion of it is ALL surface; all angles and planes. The production is so high-dollar and expensive that it threatens to drown her out in a web of glassy synths and non-organic instrumentation; her collabs with head OneRepublic-an Ryan Tedder is/are a classic case in point, as Tedder, for all his success, still hasn't quite figured out how to let his singer take the lead, as it should be. The only time on this drawn-out near-50-minute excursion into pop music's version of drone/doom is on the Greg Kurstin production (and first single) ""Hello"". It's a good study in not only allowing the singer to take center stage, but also allowing her overpower the production. It's no wonder Kurstin is a sought-after producer; much like Max Martin did with Britney Spears' first efforts, he allows the vocals and music to BREATHE. Elsewhere, the music is overstuffed and overproduced, turning what could have been great songs into an non-melodic and unlistenable mess. God only knows how Taylor has gotten away with this spotty garbage for two records straight; Adele is NOT Taylor. She's supposedly better, but from this information (bloated length, near-constant whining about her ex, the intentional pseudo-bluster and the intentional plod), she should look at Kelly Clarkson, who is the only one I've heard for quite some time who can imbue a heartbreak anthem with real, tangible emotive power. Adele...back to the drawing board. You missed."
pos,"Unexpectedly hurled into the ether at the end of October, The Stage has already been widely hailed as one of Avenged Sevenfold?s most convincing statements to date. As the one metal band of their generation with genuine stadium-filling potential on both sides of the Atlantic, the Californians could have been forgiven for repeating the thunderous, simplistic anthems of 2013?s Hail to the King, but instead they have blown the creative doors off, cramming an insane amount of ideas into 74 minutes of prog-metal bombast. Their knack for a chorus is as apparent on the shorter, sharper likes of Paradigm and God Damn, but it?s the outrageous opulence of towering ballads Higher and Roman Sky, and the overblown, starry-eyed Muse-ings of 16-minute closer Exist, that make this such a satisfying forward leap. Detractors may point to a triumph of showmanship over soulfulness, but this is so exuberant, preposterous and colourful that the only reasonable response is to stand and applaud.

"
pos,Avenged Sevenfold ?really divide rock fans. One camp berates them as style-over-substance guyliner-wearing pussies. The other side rates ?their constant reinvention and epiclive show
pos,"Coming off a Best New Artist Award at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, the members of Avenged Sevenfold returned to the studio, ambitious to create an exciting follow-up to City of Evil -- perhaps overly so, as their self-titled release focuses entirely too hard on pushing the songs into non-metal territory. Their signature, blistering Yngwie Malmsteen guitar arpeggios and lightning fast double-kick drums are still evident, but the overall heavy metal thunder is diluted by their everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach. Left alone in the studio to record the album on their own, AS show their unbridled enthusiasm to be as inventive as possible as they run through a staggering amount of production enhancements: four songs have string arrangements; violinists, pianists, and vocalists make guest appearances here and there; ""A Little Piece of Heaven"" is a strange Mr. Bungle type number with sax, clarinet, trombone, and trumpet, and ""Unbound (The Wild Ride)"" throws in the most un-metal addition of all -- a children's choir. Some of these enhancements help take the songs to the next level but most detract, and give the sensation of inappropriately mashed-up styles, like listening to a Dream Theateralbum on a boom box while a nearby clock radio plays Charlie FM. Vocalist M. Shadows, who required surgery on his vocal cords after Waking the Fallen shows that his training with Ron Anderson (vocal coach for Layne Staley, Axl Rose, and Chris Cornell) has been for the greater good. Rather than screaming or doing the metal growl, he sings in a few gritty voices, showing an obvious Mike Pattoninfluence, and actually sounds pitch-perfect. His skills, and the entire band's technical ferocity, is flawless as ever, but just gets lost in a cluttered vision. Perhaps the worst culprit of their excessive studio trickery is when a Cher-esque ""Believe"" pitch corrector/vocoder is introduced to the chorus of ""Lost,"" essentially stomping out a fiery '80s speed-metal jam into lukewarm embers of pass‚ electro. While their willingness to experiment is admirable, despite the fact that they've gone overboard with their overdubs, the overabundance of studio polish leaves one to wonder if it's not because the songs just aren't as strong this time around."
neg,Rihanna sound so cheap and ordinary on this album. I can't get her energy. Songs are written by other artist. I can't see anything about talent. She is just saying the same words again and again.

pos,"With just a couple of cursory listens to the few tracks that popped up all over the Internet through 2007, comparisons were made between Adele, the much-hyped brassy British songstress, and Amy Winehouse, the...much-hyped brassy British songstress. However, after a solid listen to 19, the first full sampling by the up-and-coming Adele, listeners are forced to throw all comparisons to the wind; Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone. Bluesy like it's no one's business yet voluptuously funky in a contemporary way, Adele rocks out 19 with a unique voice and gritty sound that dazzle endlessly. Synthesizing blues, jazz, folk, soul, and even electric pop, Adele mystifies through her mature songwriting skills and jaw-dropping arrangements. As the album opens with ""Daydreamer,"" Adele's illusionary instrument -- over minimal sounds -- engulfs the listener with a gorgeous feeling of awe and wonderment. On ""Melt My Heart to Stone"" and the bona fide hit ""Chasing Pavements,"" Adele allows herself to soar over the strings and power her way through these incredible songs. The upbeat ""Right as Rain"" is just wonderful, with clear Ashford & Simpson influences speckled all over it in an upbeat set. Nearly all the tracks seem to have been nurtured to glory over months as labors of love. What's simply awesome on 19 is its capability to capture the listener through mere teasing; Adele doesn't shout for attention, and doesn't rely on anyone but herself to prove she's worth it, in the same vein as Sara Bareilles, another heavily praised artist of 2007. The jazzy ""Best for Last"" is as retro as the tunes get on the album, yet it still manages to steer away from being boring or old-fashioned. The only awkwardness throughout all of 19 is the overly poppy galactic ""Tired,"" which sounds as though it might have fallen off a Lily Allen track list, something that doesn't suit Adele as a musician. As far as artistic drive goes, it seems as though Adele is hoping to capitalize on the sounds of 2007 by borrowing elements of Feist, Regina Spektor, Norah Jones, and even, yes, Amy Winehouse; yet Adele blends all the artistic pizzazz of all those ladies into her own set of manipulative, glamorous wonder. Plus, as a terrific songwriter at merely 20 years of age, the Brit has so much room to expand her artistic dimensions into a full-fledged artist that it's no wonder most critics see her as the top new talent of 2008. This debut isn't an empty promise of a great career; 19 is a fleshed-out stunning portrayal of a young woman with a talent beyond her years who deserves immense credit for a unique style that never fails. A beyond stellar debut in both quality and originality."
pos,"The iTunes/MySpace revolution has speeded up the pop process to such an extent that a new act barely has time to draw breath before being acclaimed in ever-growing hyperbole and seeing their debut album go straight to No 1.
But, though superficially impressive, this is often disastrous for the artist's long-term prospects, destroying the vital growth period during which musicians develop their performing acumen, musical tastes, and the kind of world-view obtained only through years of hard knocks. Instead, artists are now catapulted up the pop mountainside and expected to grab hold of whatever outcrop is within their grasp, and grimly hold on for dear life. To then criticise and condemn an Amy Winehouse when she struggles seems churlish at best, and often downright vindictive.
Adele Adkins, another pupil from the Brit performing arts school attended by Amy and Kate Nash, is the latest recipient of this hype. Am I the only one to find something slightly sinister in the way we're being brow-beaten into unanimous acclaim for her modest talents, with Adele acclaimed in some BBC poll of industry insiders as ""the sound of 2008"" and virtually guaranteed a Brit Award before anyone's actually heard her album? Let's see: stage school background, voting for your favourite, straight in at No 1 ? is this anything more than the extension of Cowell-ist principles from mainstream pop to those areas of music that used to be considered more personal and distinctive?
And in Adele's case, it's pretty much the same sort of shallow-but-showy vocal facility favoured by TV talent contests that's being praised, her delivery sounding like a convenient blending of Winehouse's R&B chops with Nash's mockney mannerisms: interesting in small doses (notably ""Hometown Glory""), it becomes irritating over a full album. In sparse settings, as here, she struggles to sustain one's interest ? a situation not helped by a narrow, youthful focus on romantic themes. There's a limit to the appeal of teenage crushes, brush-offs and frustrations, and Adele sails blithely beyond it.
If she were a relative unknown, this wouldn't matter much: she would develop a broader outlook at her own pace. But thrust so prematurely into the limelight, Adele has to effect those changes in full view of the public, with each step reported in the mandatory weblog diary. Is it any wonder that mystique is a vanishing commodity in pop, or that the cycle of acclaim and contempt is now so rapid? 19 is a passably decent debut, but it could have been so much more by being so much less anticipated.

"
pos,"Like fellow crooners Amy Winehouse and Kate Nash, Adele Adkins polished her skills at the Brit School in south London ? as good a finishing academy as American Idol. Her debut, which topped the British charts earlier this year, lacks the bad-girl brio of those grads, but it shows off a vocal instrument that smokes the competition. Check out ?Cold Shoulder,? a lover?s blues, produced by Winehouse?s secret weapon, Mark Ronson: Over swirling strings and a snare pattern borrowed from James Brown?s ?Funky Drummer,? Adele reads her man the riot act with a mix of Memphis-soulmama swoops and cockney-street-punk stops. ?Melt My Heart to Stone? and ?Tired,? co-written with veteran U.K. hit-maker Eg White, are retro-modern R&B exercises with similar charm. On more sparsely arranged numbers, though ? including a measured cover of Dylan?s unlikely pop standard ?Make You Feel My Love? ? her marvelous technique can become cloying, and the boilerplate verses on her originals don?t help. Here?s hoping the girl?s storytelling will one day be as interesting as her phrasing."
pos,"Two years (and a bit) on from 19, Adele Adkins comes of age sounding as wise beyond her years as she did in 2008. While 19 detailed the end of a relationship with ""an idiot"", 21 is about the end of something great. There's cheating, jealously, joy and heartbreak contained within; all stripped into shape by a galactico squad sheet of producers ? starting with Rick Rubin and Ryan Tedder and working down to current British studio darlings Paul Epworth and Fraser T Smith. But it's former Semisonic man Dan Wilson who is responsible for the album's highlight, the gorgeous Someone Like You, certain to be coming soon to a montage near you. The tale of Adkins facing up to the end of a love ? ""never mind, I'll find someone like you"" ? is half heart-wrenching, half uplifting. It's nearly good enough reason to break up with someone, simply so you can mope in it. Other moments of note come in a Sufjanesque takedown of the Cure's Lovesong; the single Rolling in the Deep (inspired by a Nashville-schooled US tourbus driver) and the immediately familiar, Dusty-does-Dulwich sound of I'll Be Waiting. A progressive, grown-up second collection, it ought to ensure Adele is around for 23, 25, 27 and beyond."
pos,"Three years on from her 19 debut, 21 finds Adele feigning maturity ? ""I was a child then"", she claims in ""I'll Be Waiting"" ? though in many cases here, that apparently involves a sad capitulation to the kind of dreary ballads and overwrought delivery that does her few favours.
Things begin well enough with the single ""Rolling in the Deep"", with its thumping piano quadruplets and gospelly backing vocals, and continues reasonably with the galumphing Tom Waits-style arrangement of ""Rumour Has It""; until, two-thirds of the way through the song, it grinds to a halt for a slower, torchy middle eight. This proves a harbinger of the rest of the album, which sinks into a mire of turgid, characterless piano balladry swamped in routine string arrangements, the sole respite from which comes in the deep soul number ""One and Only"", her best vocal performance here.

"
pos,"What a difference two years make. When Brit school graduate Adele Atkins released her debut album 19 (her age at the time), she seemed, along with the likes of Lily Allen and Kate Nash, part of a stampede of sparky young London singers who followed in the wake of Amy Winehouse.
While 19 went to number one and she picked up the inaugural Critics? Choice Brit award, what distinguished Adele from the similarly retro-voiced Duffy was the name she made for herself across the Atlantic, where she won two Grammys and influential fans such as Bob Dylan and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.
It is that American success that has shaped Atkins?s follow-up album. It?s steeped in Southern blues, country and soul. In another singer?s hands this might seem a nakedly ambitious attempt to appeal to the American charts, but Atkins makes the material sound genuine, largely because it is perfect for her. Where previously her slight, observational songs seemed barely able to carry her powerful voice, the emotional and musical heft of these styles enables her to really spread her vocal wings.
And her voice is a thing of wonder. There is warmth, power and vulnerability, sometimes in the same note. She has less of the unpredictable edge of Amy Winehouse, or the am-dram cool of Florence Welch, but she has a far greater range and subtlety than either, and hers is a voice that seems to go right to your heart.
Producers Rick Rubin and Paul Epworth have done the right thing by foregrounding that and leaving the musical background solid and unshowy. Whether she can sell American country sounds to a British audience remains to be seen, but avoiding the dancefloor pyrotechnics that so many singers are drawn to at the moment is a wise move ? on this album she out-divas them all.

"
pos,"The first time that I heard Adele, I was in a Borders store (back when there were Borders stores), and ""Rumour Has It"" was playing over the speakers. The echoing, bluesy drums, the 60's soul backup singers, and the lead singer's gutsy, emotional performance were just too good to ignore. ""Who is this,"" I had to ask the clerk wandering about the store. ""Adele,"" I was told. I'd never heard of her, but I bought this album that day on the strength of that one song. It's something I rarely do, and I certainly have not regretted it.

Lots of musical artists have been called the ""voice of a generation."" Usually that is the burdensome title given to songwriters who represent the trials, concerns, and strengths of the people of their era: Dylan, Springsteen, Cobain. As a songwriter, Adele is not on their level. She writes good songs, to be sure, but it's her performance of those songs that make listening to them a special experience. Thus she is literally the VOICE of her generation, in the same way that Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, or Whitney Houston could be said to be the voice of theirs. That person who, when their mouth opens, something primordial inside of the listener is awakened.

Beyond the sheer magnitude of her vocals, I am a sucker for albums that blend genres organically, without seeming to try. Blues, gospel, soul, jazz, and of course pop are all represented here, not by Adele switching from one style to the next song by song but by adapting each of them into every song in a way that never feels forced. Impressive stuff, coming from a 21 year old."
pos,"If I'm being honest, I avoided Adele at first. By and large I don't tend to be a big fan of top 20 music. But talent will always rise and when I finally got over my own prejudice I haven't heard singles as good as Rolling in the Deep and Rumor Has It in a very long time."
pos,I love this album! 21 is so much better than Adele's 1st album! This album shows how Adele has grown and matured since her 1st album! The songs are fun and enjoyable!
pos,"Sheer brilliance. Perfection. 21 is hands-down one of the best albums to come out in the last 20 years. Adele's flawless vocals bring to life an emotionally passionate piece of work with strong lyrics, great production, and an awing mystique."
pos,"I am not a big fan of Adele but ""21"" is a very good album. It is a pop album which has ballads which have been made to sound anthemic and big with their music and the lyrics are sad and full of break up stories and how ""I'm wrong and people don't like me"". The melodies are very good and I like how Adele doesn't have top prove that she is a great vocalist with exaggerated vocals Celine Dion on 95 % of her hit songs. Adele uses her voice to sing the songs and not to make her voice more important the songs. She does like it should be - voice is just a normal part of the song, and its not any song's duty to be for her vocals. her vocals sound much like Aretha Franklin but it is the only soul music reference on this album.

The songs? I like ""Rolling in the Deep"" and ""Someone Like You"" but my two favorite songs are ""Set Fire to the Rain"" (so much emotion!) and ""Rumour Has it"" (it is very different from other songs of the album for its rhythm and the percussion is almost leading the song). ""Turning Tables"" and ""Don't You remember"" are also touching and with good melodies. ""I'll Be Waiting"" sounds good because the vocals has been constructed in a different way compared to the other songs. ""Lovesong"" is the only letdown here. It is a boring song and should have been left out.

So, this is Adele's best album so far. I didn't care about ""19"" apart from two or three good songs and the next album ""25"" was a slower and boring version of this album. It is usual to make a similar album with minto changes to make more money if the previous album sold many million copies. It should not be a defense though."
pos,"The best thing about Adele's success is that it is well deserved commercially because she stands out as artists of our generation. That there are not many others known & at the same level musically, is another matter.
40 years ago, Adele would have had to compete with tough quality competition, today she filters the noise to conquer the throne of passionate songwriter pop.
As Kenneth points out, 21's compositions are pretty good but where expectations are exceed is the execution - flawless vocals, thoughtful arrangements and the best of music of the past.
Adele is in the position to teach these youngsters how soulful open music was done long time ago!And hopefully, many of the listeners will start exploring similar music.
Adele is an full-spectrum artist by her heart and head which is a great promise for her live appearances and next recordings!"
pos,"This album is a fucking classic!! Adele really set the bar high for her following albums and I hope she can match the intensity of these songs sometime down the road! ?Set Fire to the Rain?, an album highlight is so, so, so beautiful. One of the most moving power ballads I?ve ever heard in my freakin? life! ?? The songs are generally catchy and the melodies are so classic and had so much work put into them. This is my favorite Adele album although for some reason it?s my least played on last.fm. So dope really. I can?t say enough about this album! It definitely deserved to sell 10 million copies in the US and go Diamond. That certification is well-deserved!"
pos,"Autobiography is baked into Adele's art. She called her first album 19, naming it after her age at the time of writing, and like a musical, millennial Michael Apted, each successive album represented another chapter in her life's story. Fueled by heartbreak, her roiling 2011 record 21 ushered in her adulthood and superstardom, two acts that were instrumental in the creation of 25, the 2015 album purportedly documenting her mid-twenties. Between 21 and 25, Adele fell in love and started a family, an event that would surely be grist for a memoirist's mill if Adele was as confessional a singer/songwriter as she appears, but she is not. Like 21 before it, the love that flows through 25 is either curdled or lost, love that can no longer replenish or nourish. It is certainly not the kind of love that would arise from a satisfying, stable relationship, but it is indeed the kind of love that is recognizable from 21: love that hurts, not heals. While her themes may remain the same, Adele isn't the same singer as she was in 2011, nor is 25 a carbon copy of 21. Success has given her the confidence to abandon any lingering Amy Winehouseinfluence, taking along with it any sense of swing or sass. Max Martin and Shellback give ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"" a subdued, spliced electronic pulse, just enough of a rhythm to distinguish the track from the rest of the record. But it and the cinematically surging ""Water Under the Bridge"" -- a song begging to be played over the closing credits of an inspirational biopic -- wither when compared to the wallop of ""Rolling in the Deep."" This stateliness is intentional, forcing attention with both the full force gale that is Adele's voice and, not so coincidentally, her placid good taste. It isn't so much that Adeledoesn't take risks -- she's hip enough to enlist Haim/Charli XCX's producer to helm ""When We Were Young,"" a song co-written with hotly tipped sensitive soul Tobias Jesso, Jr., and she brings in Danger Mouse to help orchestrate the neo-gospel of ""River Lea."" But she's so devoted to ballads, ballads determined to convey grace and strength in the face of loss that she winds up residing in a middle of the road, which makes her seem much older than the quarter century of the title. Adele doesn't help matters by dwelling on the passage of time, repeatedly returning to the idea that she ain't a kid anymore. It's a sentiment that suits a singer many years past 25 yet also suggests a bit of savvy on her part: these are songs that are meant to be heard -- and sung -- for years after the album's initial release, gathering resonance with the passage of time. Fittingly, 25 also plays better over the long haul, its march of slow songs steadily revealing subtle emotional or musical distinctions. Make no mistake, all 11 songs are of a piece -- they're shaded by melancholy, gaining most of their power through performance -- but that cohesive sound only accentuates how Adele has definitively claimed this arena of dignified heartbreak as her own.

pos,"Adele Adkins? retro-soul debut,ÿ19, was striking less for her songs than for that voice: a voluptuous, slightly parched alto that swooped and fluttered like a Dusty Springfield student trying to upstage her teacher, or at least update the rules. Now that she?s legal ?ÿ21ÿrefers to her age when she wrote these songs ? Adele has toughened her tone, trimmed the jazz frippery and sounds ready for a pub fight. ?Go ahead and sell me out/And I?ll lay your shit bare,? she promises an ex-lover on ?Rolling in the Deep,? a soul burner with hand claps and a kick drum whumping like a fist on a sandbag. (The new approach seems to be working:ÿ21ÿhas already topped the charts in eight countries.)"
pos,"There?s something curiously irrelevant about reviewing Adele?s third studio album. The astonishing sales of its first single, Hello, suggest that global success on a scale unseen since the last time Adelereleased an album is already a foregone conclusion. The public seems even less interested in critical opinion than usual, if such a thing is possible. It has already been taken as read that 25 is a masterpiece: its quality isn?t up for question. 
Certainly, no one who buys it is going to angrily return it to the shop because it wasn?t what they expected. For the most part, 25 sticks close to the formula of the best-known tracks on its predecessor, 21: big, piano-led ballads, decorated with strings and brass, dealing with heartbreak. In fact, most of them seem to deal with exactly the same heartbreak that fuelled 21: five years on, Adele is still, metaphorically speaking, planted on her ex?s lawn at 3am, tearfully lobbing her shoes at his bedroom window.
You can see why this has happened. 21?s vast success was at least partially predicated on the personal nature of the songwriting, but the things that have happened in Adele?s personal life since its release ? vast fame and its attendant pressures, domestic contentment and motherhood ? are difficult topics to write about without sounding ungrateful or trite respectively. That said, she occasionally gives it a go: Remedy offers a bit of Fix You-style sentimentality, and Million Years Ago rather affectingly depicts old friends who now ?can?t look me in the eye, it?s like they?re scared of me?.
But the fact that she often ends up addressing a topic that has already been fairly thoroughly addressed is a problem. The songs are invariably beautifully delivered ? in a world of singers who feel impelled to express emotion by vocally doing their nut, Adele understands that less is usually more ? but something is missing from them. The raw emotional edge that was part of 21?s appeal is noticeable by its absence, replaced by what sounds less like closure and reconciliation than a certain pass-aggy bent: ?Send my love to your new lover,? she sings brightly, ?I hope you treat her better.? In fact, it?s hard not to start feeling your sympathy shift a little from the dumpee to the dumper. ?When I call you never seem to be home,? she protests on Hello, which does rather make you think: well, you have just sold 30m copies of an album largely concerned with telling the world what a terrible shit he is. He?s probably trying to keep a fairly low profile.
There?s an argument that 25 bears comparison to the work of John Grant, another confessional singer-songwriter who has thus far wrung two hugely acclaimed albums of material out of a single failed relationship. The big difference is that there?s none of Grant?s blackly comic laughter here, none of his leavening self-deprecating humour. Grant is always tipping you the wink that he knows he?s going on a bit; Adele, on the other hand, just seems to be going on a bit. ?This is never ending, we?ve been here before,? she sings on Love in the Dark. You can say that again.
In fairness, the feeling that you?re heading once more down a very well-trodden path matters less when the music really clicks: Hello is a pretty bulletproof bit of songwriting, and All I Ask sounds appealingly like the showstopping ballad from a hugely successful Broadway musical. Often, though, it slinks unremarkably into the middle of the road. They?re not bad songs as such, but they feel slightly ordinary, distinguished only by her voice, a state of affairs compounded by the fact that the much of the album proceeds at the same, fairly glacial pace.
The biggest disappointment turns out to be the album?s most anticipated collaboration, When We Were Young, co-authoured by lauded Canadian songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr. It should have been intriguing to hear his obsession with music made in mid-70s California ? Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, the Lennon of Walls and Bridges ? rubbing up against Adele?s crowd-pleasing songwriting approach, but somehow they have contrived to come up with a song that sounds like something Jimmy Young might have played on Radio 2 in 1978. Clearly no one buys an Adele album expecting bleeding-edge sonic innovation, in much the same way that no one buys a Sleaford Mods album in the hope of finding a tear-jerking ballad suitable for performing at The X Factor final, but the feeling that it doesn?t all have to be quite as rounded-edged as this is hard to shake.
By contrast, 25?s best moments come when someone pushes Adele ? or Adele pushes herself ? beyond just recreating former glories. Set to a finger-picked acoustic guitar, Million Years Ago is audibly influenced by French chanson, its lovely melody recalling in equal parts Charles Aznavour?s Hier Encore and the old Theme from Mash, Suicide Is Painless. Her two collaborations with longstanding producer Paul Epworth are great, particularly I Miss You, which is wreathed in ghostly backing vocals, tumbling drums and time-stretched, vaguely dubstepish vocal samples. Likewise the Danger Mouse-helmed River Lea ? the closest thing the album comes to its predecessor?s Rolling in the Deep ? its organ-led, faintly gospel-like mood given a tiny hint of strangeness by the producer?s liberal application of echo.
It?s an album that could have done with more stuff like that: more variety, more sense of an artist using the space and freedom that shifting 30m units buys you to move on, at least a little. As it is, 25?s big issue is that, in every sense, it dwells a little too heavily on the past.
"
pos,"The anticipation has been carefully stoked through the past few months, first by leaked rumours and suppositions, including the revelations of snubbed collaborators that led Phil Collins to describe her as ?slippery?, followed by the release of little sting videos like the one in which she sings ?When We Were Young?, then more concretely by the release of ?Hello?, with its monochrome promo video featuring Adele shouting at a pond about an argument that seemed to happen years before, and complaining that ?How come when I call you, you never seem to be home??.
To which query there are two obvious answers, the first being that the phone box is overgrown with creepers and clearly out of order. The second is that her call involves the invitation for a former lover to meet up and ?go over everything?, which in an unscientific survey of the things most men would least like to do was only narrowly beaten by being stuck in a broken lift with the presenters of Loose Women. 

?Hello? is the opening track of 25, and it ticks all the boxes required by the five-album punter, from the sombre piano chords portending emotional torment, to the carefully-modulated build to a satisfying emotional climax. It?s the first of three tracks produced by Greg Kurstin, though both ?Water Under The Bridge? and ?Million Years Ago? are far subtler in style, the arrangements pared back to just percussion and lone guitar figures, to allow Adele?s banked background vocals to carry the songs.
There are isolated moments of musical intrigue scattered here and there through the album - the Danger Mouse-produced ?River Lea?, for instance, has a cavernous moodiness that falls away near the end to reveal Adele?s intricately-layered acappella vocals, and the track helmed by Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin & Shellback, ?Send My Love (To Your New Lover)?,  features even more ingeniously-arranged banks of harmonies layered to sound like a playground skipping-song.
But as 25 continues, it?s gradually swamped by the kind of dreary piano ballads that are Adele?s fall-back position, produced by the likes of Ryan Tedder and Bruno Mars? Smeezingtons operation. It leaves things sounding a little too much like they had been designed by committee - which, on reflection, is probably exactly what those industry types were so eagerly awaiting.

neg,"Beatles For Sale is a frustrating showing for the band, marred by the defects that had seemingly been conquered on their previous effort. The group's spectacular songwriting had proven to be their greatest asset, transfiguring their well intentioned covers into a chronic annoyance. Furthermore, on this outing even their stellar songwriting began to suffer a bit, most likely due to the inevitable burnout that arrives when you're expected to produce far too much good material in a short amount of time. Nonetheless that originals remain strong for the most part, guaranteeing that the album is at least pretty good, if not up to the group's recent standards. The album's often derided as a total misfire, but despite its myriad flaws this is far from the case, as even when the band falters they're still light years above most pop groups, and there are far too many good originals to wholly write the album off."
neg,"""ANTi"" is a disappointed. Three years in the making and this is the result? You'd think she'd deliver a revolutionary, well-produced, brilliant piece of art. But no, ""ANTi"" is a compilation of garbage in audio form. And who the hell let her record ""Higher""? It sounds like an MP3 audio of a dying cat, felt very sorry for my ears. And ""Work"" is the definition of generic mediocrity. Most of the tracks sound like unfinished demos. This album is just junk. Pretentious to the max. From her horrible vocals to the atrocious productions, I can say I enjoyed the silence in between the songs. Rihanna used to bring the goods to the table but now she seems to have left them somewhere else. It is hard to believe that someone is nice enough to spend their hard-earned money to buy this piece of shit I wish I could give this album a score below 0 because it is truly one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. But thankfully, I listened to ""Revival"" by Selena Gomez and recovered from this horrible experience"
neg,"Rihanna has made me unhappy all year, her music is not ""cool"" this time. Your ""work"" gets no points from me, worst song I've ever heard. The most overrated song I have ever had the misfortune to witness in years. I have never disliked a song more in my life. A pathethic noise on the airwaves. ""Needed me"" shouldn't be anywhere either. What are those songs doing in the billboard? Streams. Rihanna has really damaged the music on the streaming era. There is no way she is the best artist or the most favorite of everyone, what a farce. In fact she is the worst and my least favorite of all time. Awful."
neg,"With all due respect to Rihanna from me, she has always been hitmakers dance and try to show off and to stand as a serious artist suffered a complete fiasco! This musical misunderstanding worthy a single maximum listening and then only with difficulty, This is boring!"
neg,"Well, the albums start with a good song but the more we listen the more we get borred, Great songs like ""Kiss It Better"" & ""Same Ol Mistakes"", and very very bad ones like ""Pose"" & ""Woo"""
pos,"Aside from the mountains of cash, the fabulous manicures and ceiling-scraping blow-dries, the adulation of millions and being born with the gift of a golden voice, it can?t have been easy being Adele of late. It?s got to be pretty scary following up one of the most successful albums ever ? 2011?s ?21? is the fourth best selling in UK chart history ? even if you know your new one?s a dead cert for number one (?25? is expected to sell between 1.3 and 1.8 million copies in its first week).
On ?25? we discover the 27-year-old?s response to such a dilemma is a sensible ? if not entirely novel ? one. This is the sound of someone playing the game so safely they might as well have strapped on shin-pads and a crash helmet.

 
With Adele?s sophisticated, emotive vocals unsurprisingly front and centre of all 11 tracks, we sashay from moody balladeering to smoky jazz bar grooves by way of West End worthy showtunes. ?25? is not an experimental voyage of the kind Fleetwood Mac made with 1979?s ?Tusk? or a try at fashionable hip-hop strain trap. It?s not even home to a single curveball. For her core fanbase this probably comes as sweet relief.
The closest ?25? gets to springing a surprise is on ?Send My Love (To Your New Lover)?. With pop professor Max Martin (who?s scored hits for everyone from Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys to Katy Perry and Taylor Swift) on perky production duties, she comes over like a softcore MIA, bouncing along a Femfreshed dancehall chorus, wishing her ex and their new squeeze well and sounding like she?s having a right laugh.
But from then on, it?s an unapologetic return to ?Rolling In The Deep? style high drama. Swathed in candle-lit mysticism and with a whisper of Gregorian chanting, ?I Miss You? sees Adele going full Florence (unsurprisingly given the co-writing and production credit for Paul Epworth, who has previous with both Flo and Adele). Over velvety doom-pop she urges a lover to ?kiss me back to life?. ?River Lea? continues in the same ballsy vein, a strutting, modern gospel Danger Mouse production that references her Tottenham roots. ?Water Under The Bridge? brings yet more bombast, with Adele belting out another dramatic diary entry to her ex.
Volume 0%
 
Vocally, however, she impresses most when she brings thing down a couple of notches. Against gently plucked acoustic guitar on ?Million Years Ago? she channels the hushed sensuality of 1950s jazz pinup Julie London with gloriously intimate results.
Yet you just can?t shake the feeling that the whole thing is just far too safe. You can?t blame team Adele for following a formula that has so far resulted in 30 million album sales ? but here?s to a little more innovation on ?29?.


"
pos,"Adele?s 2011 blockbuster, 21, was all about turning pain into power. Four years and 30 million albums sold later, remorse is still her muse. But where 21 was the sound of a woman soldiering through bad romance, 25 finds her queenly and resolute, lamenting the past on songs with titles like ?Water Under the Bridge? and ?When We Were Young.? Even ?Hello? is a goodbye. The nostalgic mood is the perfect fit for an artist who reaches back decades for her influences, even as her all-or-nothing urgency feels utterly modern.
Some of pop?s biggest names, from Max Martin to Bruno Mars, join familiar faces like Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder in 25?s dream team of producers and co-writers. They help create a rich set of songs without getting in the way of the lady in charge. ?River Lea,? a collaboration with Danger Mouse, is an organ-heavy soul shouter, and ?Water Under the Bridge? builds to gospel-steeped ecstasy. Adele is more somber on ?Million Years Ago,? a gorgeous acoustic reverie that suggests Caetano Veloso writing for Dusty Springfield. ?I feel like my life is flashing by,? she sings, her voice deepening with regret and sounding decades beyond her years.
The music feels more mature, too, on torchy ballads like ?When We Were Young? and ?Love in the Dark.? The most powerful moment is ?All I Ask,? a silken tempest co-written with Mars, where Adele addresses a lover on what she knows will be their final night, processing the end of an affair in what feels like slow motion. When she sings, ?Give me a memory I can use,? it?s like she?s already imagining the heartrending song she?ll craft from the experience. There?s vulnerability in that moment, but there?s also grace and resilience.  
Throughout 25, there?s a deeper sense of artistic command. In a great, intimate bit before the start of ?Send My Love (To Your New Lover),? she issues orders to the guys in the studio: ?Just the guitar.? The Martin-helmed song that follows ? built on a nimble acoustic figure ? is a farewell to an ex who couldn?t deal with Adele?s fire, sung with chill composure.

Whether she?s holding notes with the strength of a suspension bridge or enjoying a rare lighthearted ?whoo-hoo!? on ?Sweetest Devotion,? her incredible phrasing ? the way she can infuse any line with nuance and power ? is more proof that she?s among the greatest interpreters of romantic lyrics. ?No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you,? she sings on the gently lifting ?Remedy.? On 25,no feat of strength comes as a surprise. Let?s just hope the next one is called 28, and not, say, 30.Each new chapter of her story is too good to wait for.
"
pos,"Adele is back, in case anyone has failed to notice. After a three-year absence, the BRIT school graduate sang a tentative ?Hello, it?s me? on her comeback single and clocked up a million digital sales and a billion video hits in a week. Her previous album, 21, sold over 30 million copies, the only release this century to scale such dizzy heights. The ailing music industry is desperate for her to pull off the same trick again. The rest of us are just hoping for another great album full of heartfelt songs delivered with a warm, powerful voice that makes us want to sing along, punch the air and shed a tear.
The first thing to say is I don?t think anyone will be disappointed. Covering much of the same kind of musical and emotional terrain, 25 is certainly the equal of its predecessor. What it sacrifices in youthful rawness it makes up in maturity and sheer class. Adele Adkins has taken her time over her third album and it shows.
A lot is said about Adele?s fantastic singing but the key to her global success is surely that she gives herself material worth wrapping her chops around. 25 is crammed top to bottom with perfectly formed songs ? elegantly flowing melodies, direct and truthful lyrics and richly textured production ? all sung as if her life depends on it.There are deep, resonant piano ballads (Remedy, Love In The Dark and All I Ask), a brace of slinky, playful pop belters (Send My Love (To Your New Lover) and Sweetest Devotion) and some spooky, thunderous, big production dramas (I Miss You, Water Under The Bridge).
The highlight has to be River Lea, a blast of North London gospel that improbably locates the source of Adele?s musical soul in the waters of Chingford, Walthamstow and Tottenham. ?When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea / There was something in the water and now that something?s in me.?
Now 27, and a mother of one in a settled relationship, the album looks back a couple of years to a more transitional phase (hence the title). It is a collection of torch songs, filled with longing for lost love and mourning her own faded innocence, filtered through more emotional distance than the raw, hurting ballads and blues of 21.
She has worked with some of contemporary pop?s leading writer-producers, including Paul Epworth, Greg Kurstin and Max Martin. These are names that turn up everywhere in the charts, so the album?s very organic, old-fashioned flavour comes from Adele herself. Musically, she stands squarely in the middle of the road, and it is only her earthy personality and soulful honesty that lends her any kind of cutting edge. For a contemporary pop star, she never ventures much further forward in musical eras than the Eighties. You can detect nods to Lionel Richie, Phil Collins, Carole King, Burt Bacharach and even the chanson of Charles Aznavour, with a hint of Enya?s Orinoco Flow in the rhythm and melody of Sweetest Devotion. But it would be churlish to carp when pop doesn?t come much more perfect than this.
The beauty of Adele?s singing is how effortless it is. The depth of her notes is luxurious with the slightest of croaks in her upper range lending a twist of soul. She gives herself space, words falling neatly with music and rhythm, albeit she has the advantage of being able to stretch vowels and add syllables apparently at will. ?It?s so co-oo-oo- old out here-ee-eer in your weel-de-er-ne-ess? looks ridiculous in print but sounds like the truth when Adele puts her heart into it. There?s real joy in her vocal, even when she is grappling with private pain. She loves to sing, and the world loves to hear her.

"
neg,"Once again resorting mostly to the uninteresting rock-a-billy style over more unique ideas, Beatles For Sale still has a few golden nuggets like ""No Reply,"" ""Eight Days a Week,"" and ""Every Little Thing,"" which keeps things at least musically interesting."
pos,"Adele has a pretty amazing voice, and this album, 25, shows it off much better than her previous ones. Songs like Million Years Ago, Hello and All I Ask are totally awesome. I thought 19 and 21 were duds but this one is a definite thumbs up!"
neg,"Maybe the worst Beatles album (I don't include Yellow Submarine!) - Not as cohesive as a ""Hard Days Night"", with half the songs being covers. This is the first where some of the original songs have a melancholic edge, probably having been influenced by the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. They are clearly trying to be grown up, but it's not quite working, and you wouldn't rate Lennon McCartney as a song writing force if you only had these tunes to listen to. I don't mind ""No Reply"", and as an example of candy covered pop ""Eight Days A Week"" has its merits but most of the rest is dreadful."
neg,"The album has a good background and concept, but it just don?t have a defined rhythm or a good musicality, which makes it looks desorganized and feel boring."
pos,"This is a good album. No more no less. I Don't think it's the dud Victor Brunatto thinks it is, but I don't think it's the masterpiece Ja-Quisha Frazier makes it out to be either. Hello and river lea are superb. Water under the bridge and I miss you aren't bad either, but this album isn't a 5-star album and it's not a dud. It's just a good album."
pos,"I just purchased Adele ""25"" and the cd is AWESOME!!! She is no stranger in my household and she is such a talented young lady! The song ""Hello"" is what inspired me to buy her cd and so far I have a few more favorites in addition to ""Hello"" like ""Send Your Love"" and ""I Miss You!"" ADELE YOU ARE FANTASTIC!"
pos,"Let's face it, 21 was a monster of an album, both in terms of commercial success and musical power. Any follow-up is bound to disappoint, and, to an extent, 25 does disappoint. The variety of 21 is missing, as nearly every song mines the melodramatic songs of love lost for which the singer has become famous, exemplified by the album opener (and massive single) ""Hello."" However, there's no denying that Adele's voice remains hauntingly powerful. For me, the highlight is ""Million Years Ago,"" which benefits from more sincere songwriting, as well as different instrumentation, adding some much needed variety to the album. As song after song of misery and loneliness delivered with epic vocal bombast roll by, 25 can be a trying listen, but it is still representative of a rare talent in top form."
pos,I love this album! Adele impressed me with this album! 25 shows Adele growing and maturing as an artist! The songs are catchy and fun! 25 is out now! Buy the album! You will love this album! Welcome back Adele!
pos,Adele has done it again. This album is amazing. The only flaw is the production which is also really good.
pos,"Although her most bloated piece of work, 25 is still brilliant. In relation to her previous efforts, this is the most contemporary that Adele has sounded in her entire career. The production here is quite modern and her vocals are at their most matured and grand. Songs like ""Hello,"" ""When We Were Young,"" and ""Million Years Ago"" are produced to never go out of style, while others like ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover),"" ""I Miss You,"" and ""Water Under the Bridge,"" adhere to a more modern pop production while remaining just as timeless."
pos,"At first listen, the album is for me as average compared to 19 and 21. However with new hearings will be realizing previously unnoticed details that make such a great work.
Although it appears to be easier to use, there is good quality in the compositions, Adele's voice is wonderful as ever and could possibly be heard within a few years into the future without seeming old-fashioned.
A great record that perhaps deserves to market acceptance in response to an excellent advertising campaign.
The international music market in the mainstream is so weak that it works like that sound like works of art."
pos,"I like this CD very much and will be playing it a lot. This is what I want from Adele, new songs, but not departing from her style. I don't want something that is not the Adele music I love."
pos,"The Beatles' Second Albumÿwas the first album of the group's work to be assembled by Capitol Records exclusively for the American market (as opposed to, say,ÿMeet the Beatles!, which was a reconfigured and shortened version ofÿWith the Beatles). As such, it offends some historical purists, who don't think of it as a real album. Regardless of its origins, however,ÿThe Beatles' Second Albumÿstands as probably best pure rock & roll album ever issued of the group's music. In the process of pulling songs from various British and American EPs, singles (including ""She Loves You"") and B-sides, as well as tracks left over from the editing ofÿWith the Beatlesÿfor American release, the compilers somehow managed to avoid any trace of the pop ballads favored byÿPaul McCartneyÿthat usually slowed down the group's other early albums, and the result was the longest uninterrupted body of hard rock & roll and R&B in their entire output. No other long-player by the group featured them doing more covers of songs by black American artists or songwriters, includingÿLittle Richard(""Long Tall Sally""),ÿChuck Berryÿ(""Roll Over Beethoven""),ÿSmokey Robinsonÿ(""You Really Got a Hold on Me""),ÿBarrett Strongÿ(""Money""), and others, and just to show how rich a vein this all was at the time of its release, the version of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" here actually charted briefly as a single, while ""Long Tall Sally"" served as their concert finale."
pos,"Although one of many US cobbled together LP's, I still love this album. Perhaps because I grew up with it but mainly because although it contains a lot more covers than any other Beatles LP, their covers are amazing. Every one - Long, Tall Sally< Please Mr. Postman - any title you pick is improved on by the band. They bring an energy and drive that makes their version of the song the definitive version.
And then of course, you get their own compositions. The thing is, this album hangs together as a great rocking album. Everyone always ceded the harder rock title to the Rolling Stones and the great rock lead work to Keith Richards - well, I will put The Beatles and George Harrison's biting lead guitar up against any band of their day or really of any time.
When The Beatles rocked out, there was a joy to what they did that infected the listener and invited them to join them in the sheer delight that rock n roll music can be when it's done right."
pos,"A good rocking follow up for ""Meet The Beatles"". And I dig the very mid '60's album art."
pos,This is the first I have ever heard. Of course being born in 1966 it wasn't until I was about 4 that I first heard it. It put a major music footprint in my life and pretty much started my love for music.

Rihanna tried to be different and ended up making a bad album. 
This has nothing innovative. 
And it is only sustained by the fans as going all out for the album not fail.

neg,To much hype for a dissapointing album with boring songs that all sound almost the same. Rihanna needs to get her shit together and make great music again
neg,"Here's the thing: Pop is Rihanna's stream. I seriously understand the fact that she wants to be taken more seriously as an artist and thinks that incongruently mixing genres ranging from club hip hop, trip hop and soul would give her that, but it flops. ""Love on the Brain"" is more of the direction she should have followed. When she described the album she used ""soulful"" to describe the whole thing however this is the only song that subscribes to that ideal. ""Work"" I must admit did better commercially than I thought it would however we have lost that essence of Rihanna being a vocal artist! She screams and scratches all the time now which detracts from the dynamic it used to have and adds to this ever increases idea that she is losing her voice or worse yet lazy. I must appreciate the raw energy that she pours into her work very few artists (ahem Beyonce) still have that. I have always been a RIHANNA FAN and I am avidly waiting for something more from the next album"
neg,"I think a mockery of rihanna , THEREFORE wait to get boring album said and meaningless, his voice seems drugged , I'm not one to want something commercial but those songs that seem demos, really ?? I think if she had not created much expectation I had not had very bad reviews"
neg,"I used to love everything she made but this album is a big mess. In my opinion, its best song is Love On The Brain and it sounds exactly like BEYONCê's ""worst"" song: Superpower."
pos,"It was inevitable that the constant grind of touring, writing, promoting, and recording would grate on the Beatles, but the weariness of Beatles for Sale comes as something of a shock. Only five months before, the group released the joyous A Hard Day's Night. Now, they sound beaten, worn, and, in Lennon's case, bitter and self-loathing. His opening trilogy (""No Reply,"" ""I'm a Loser,"" ""Baby's in Black"") is the darkest sequence on any Beatles record, setting the tone for the album. Moments of joy pop up now and again, mainly in the forms of covers and the dynamic ""Eight Days a Week,"" but the very presence of six covers after the triumphant all-original A Hard Day's Night feels like an admission of defeat or at least a regression. (It doesn't help that Lennon's cover of his beloved obscurity ""Mr. Moonlight"" winds up as arguably the worst thing the group ever recorded.) Beneath those surface suspicions, however, there are some important changes on Beatles for Sale, most notably Lennon's discovery of Bob Dylan and folk-rock. The opening three songs, along with ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,"" are implicitly confessional and all quite bleak, which is a new development. This spirit winds up overshadowing McCartney's cheery ""I'll Follow the Sun"" or the thundering covers of ""Rock & Roll Music,"" ""Honey Don't,"" and ""Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!,"" and the weariness creeps up in unexpected places -- ""Every Little Thing,"" ""What You're Doing,"" even George's cover of Carl Perkins' ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" -- leaving the impression that Beatlemania may have been fun but now the group is exhausted. That exhaustion results in the group's most uneven album, but its best moments find them moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career."
pos,"it?s almost a relief to see they were human after all. The manic pace of world conquest took its toll on this stopgap album, which was too hurried to include more than a few originals."
pos,"Rare in the Beatles? recorded career, this marks a slight retreat. The cover probably says it all: they look a bit shell-shocked and exhausted after two years of non-stop creativity and hysteria. Short of material, they retreat to old standards from their set, including a very cheesy Mr Moonlight, adorned by a faint, cabaret Hammond organ in the background.
But, if this is a low point, they still sound fantastic. Acoustic guitars have come to the fore, softening the attack but allowing the harmony singing to flourish. The Beatlemania pop songs are of a high standard, even if they are becoming slightly generic.
Highlights include the hand-clapping Eight Days a Week, lilting and elegant I?ll Follow the Sun and witty, Everly Brothers-style duet Baby?s in Black. But, if there is an advance to be heard on this album, it?s in Lennon?s self-immolating I?m a Loser, where you can practically hear him shucking off the artifice to bare his troubled soul

pos,"Beatles for Sale (along with Let it Be) is one of those Beatles records that Beatles fans love to hate while paradoxically still acclaiming it as a great record (The Beatles are on of the few acts that can get this kind of reaction from people). To me, it's one of my favorite Beatles records along with it's two predecessors, With the Beatles and A Hard Day's Night. Beatles for Sale shows the band exploring new lyrical territory thanks to the influence of Bob Dylan and the marijuana he introduced them to plus their own fatigue with a year and half's worth of near constant touring and performing and two straight years of immensely prolific recording, resulting in four legendary, groundbreaking albums and roughly a dozen classic stand alone singles. Naturally, this fatigue would show up in their music and it appears in several of the albums original songs such as No Reply, I'm a Loser, Baby's in Black, and I Don't Want to Spoil the Party and it even appears in few of their cover selections such both Carl Perkins covers Honey Don't (which sounds more like Elvis Presley than Carl Perkins) and Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby (which sounds more like Roy Orbison than Carl Perkins). Despite this, the album still manages to continue the fun of their previous albums, mostly in their cover selections such as Chuck Berry's Rock and Roll Music (as fantastically fun and wild as Chuck Berry's original), Little Richard's medley of Kansas City and his song Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey known as Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey and in their original Eight Days a Week while the ballad I'll Follow the Sun, is one of the albums few originals that is not angry, irritated, sad, fatigued or frustrated and is instead quite hopeful and optimistic. Beatles for Sale is underrated and often times divisive because of it's admittedly rather bi-polar/schizophrenic feel, but it's still remarkably consistent. If Beatles for Sale is one of their worst albums, then it's also one of their worst masterpieces because like it's predecessors, With the Beatles and A Hard Day's Night, it's a masterpiece."
pos,"By the looks of things, the Beatles had owned 1964. They had conquered America, had made a great movie, they had done so much in so little time, so it was no wonder the boys looked so drained and disheveled on the cover of Beatles For Sale. Beatles For Sale is a very good record, but it doesn't have the energy level of their first three albums. What it does have is their best songwriting to date and some of their more entertaining covers. The Dylan influence is also prevalent and their storytelling has become such a big part of who they are. The group also is not as dominated by the vision of John Lennon, Paul, George, and even Ringo add a flavor to the album that make the album worth the listen. Key tracks are No Reply, I'm A Loser, Baby's In Black, I'll Follow The Sun, Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Eight Days A Week, What You're Doing, and Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby."
pos,"Some people might call this album a step backwards; the music isn't quite as exciting or exuberant as the previous three albums, and it marks a return to the 8-originals with 6-covers format of the first two albums. However, this is the album that laid the groundwork for what was to come.

First off, this album marks the first divisions of the John Lennon-Paul McCartney songwriting partnership; the primary writer of any given Lennon-McCartney song would generally be its lead singer from this point forward. Also, the group were starting to take in new influences; in this case, they were adding folk music into the mix thanks to their new-found friendship with Bob Dylan. Dylan's reflection in Lennon's work was nearly immediate, thanks to tunes like ""No Reply"", ""I'm a Loser"", ""Baby's In Black"" and ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party"". Indeed, his songs were taking on a darker, melancholy tone, and the subtle moodiness and introspection would persist and evolve as his career continued. Paul McCartney's work wasn't bad here, but his own songwriting wasn't yet reaching the maturity level of John's current material or his own later work. Nevertheless, you can hear the roots of his solo career in tracks like ""I'll Follow the Sun"" and ""What You're Doing"". 

The band shows more energy in the cover tunes, such as Chuck Berry's ""Rock and Roll Music"", Buddy Holly's ""Words of Love"", Little Richard's ""Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey Hey"" and the two Carl Perkins staples ""Honey Don't"" and ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"". It's a shame they left off ""Leave My Kitten Alone"" as it would've made a fantastic addition to this album; it was finally released more than 30 years later on ""Anthology 1"".

As relatively weak as this album is next to most of their other work, the Beatles still proved themselves light years ahead of everyone else here. And without even really putting in a lot of effort either. That's a scary thought."
neg,"This album is very much a disappointment. Lil Wayne?s use of auto tune is still extremely annoying. There are a few good songs and punchlines and wordplay. But not enough to make this 23 song, hour and 30 minute long album good."
neg,"This is a bad rap album, and one that needed the shock of Internet promotion that the Jay-Z diss on ""It's Good"" gave it when C4 leaked."
neg,"From an MC that would call himself King, shouldn't we all have hoped ? nay, expected ? well, better?"
neg,"This has got to be one of the worst rap albums I've heard. Unlike its predecessor 'The Carter III', the substance that makes this album up is absolute trash and it is only carried by a few average hits. The lyrics are crap, the beats are very average, and the average delivery makes this album a dud."
neg,"all the attention is put on the singles and that is not something bad but when you hear the other tracks you realise that his lyrics are the worst of any of previous wayne records. 
one of the biggest problem for me is the auto-tune in the album. and that although there are good guests like andre-3000 the rest suck like drake and nicki minaj (especially t-pain)"
neg,"From time to time I would listen to the latest Hip Hop albums and Dwayne Carter (Little Wayne) has satisfied my needs in terms of his earlier work with gritty and plain ole' egoistic melodies and lyrics; I'm referring to Tha Carter I, II, and III. Tha Carter IV is a complete mess with vocals that isn't fitted for Hip Hop by any means and the content is beyond degrading and completely moronic. I've given this album a chance, I really did but Little Wayne is going downhill after this, don't buy this album if you're looking for anything remotely like Tha Carter II or III or something innovative and creative. The vulgarity and profanity within in the content alone is just plain ole' unnecessary which will turn mature audiences off."
neg,"this is pure trash, some of the weakest raps ive ever heard. do not buy this is a pure waste of money.. he should of just stayed in jail so we wouldnt have to him in his leopard pants."
neg,"I''m a huge fan of Weezy and I couldn't wait for this album.

The mixtapes are better than this, even in production value. I'm really, really, really disappointed with Lil Wayne on this one. I always said that if Weezy keeps putting out good mixtapes, I'd keep buying the albums. After this AND rebirth...I'll probably illegally download the next one and then decide if I want to buy it."
neg,"There's nothing of value here. He's not skilled, hard-core, interesting or original. Lil Wayne is an oil spill in the already polluted ocean of today's music that should have been cleaned up much quicker.
It's divided in two parts the side A is like a very particular Beatles take on blues and it's fantastic it add two creepy but very fun novelty songs...the side B is a conceptual work of a number of songs(eleven!) linked together and it's the best conceptual work of the Beatles together or solo...impossible not to like..
It had the best playing in any Beatles album excellent guitar tone,fantastic bass and had the best Ringo's drumming EVER
This album marks the end of The Beatles as the main force in Rock and Roll (with only Rolling Stones,Dylan and Hendrix as the main competition)...their solo albums were interesting but with the possible exception of the Plastic Ono Band, Imagine and Band on the Run albums they were never so great that when they were together
Yes,they passed the audition."
neg,"It's a shame that Lil' Wayne has to ruin perfectly good albums by rapping on them. He's clearly got the popularity and influence to pull a pretty inspiring array of collaborators. About half of these beats sound phenomenal until Wayne drops his vocals and the whole thing goes to hell; there are even terrific verses by Tech N9ne, Andre 3000, Nas, and Busta strewn around. Maybe they came hard with it to mask Lil' Wayne's lack of ability on the mic, but they failed-- they just make him sound even worse by comparison, since it's difficult for a Lil' Wayne verse to stack up against a real emcee. And Weezy sounds worse than usual here, just pooling a ridiculous array of nonsequiters and punchlines rasped out in a processed-sounding croak. Weezy has the singing voice of Emperor Palpatine, but ""How To Love"" is better than most things on this album-- at least it's the one song here where he doesn't try to convince people that he's rapping. Apparently, when it comes to hip-hop, there's only one Carter worth talking about - and I can only hope he jacks that heavenly ""Nightmares From the Bottom"" beat and puts a real song over it."
neg,"The n-word loving Kreayshawn sidekick and White Girl Mob member V-Nasty teams up with ice cream-loving Gucci Mane to make a collaboration that no one asked for. Although the pairing comes as a surprise, the mixtape boasts unimaginative lines that fall flat. In fact, BAYTL can only be appreciated if looked at for its sheer novelty appeal, thanks to V-Nasty?s laughable attempts at rapping.
At one point she claims she?s ?more hood than David Banner? (Banner took issue with her nonchalant use of the n-word), and from then on it?s obvious that she can?t be taken seriously. On every track her obnoxious and nasally voice overshadows what could have been a win for Gucci, had he dropped the Bay Area brat from his ATL style. As if her act isn?t already unconvincing, so too are her over-the-top wannabe bad bitch rhymes that obsess over ?bitches selling pussy? more than even Gucci himself cares to.
The Ice Cream Man, for the first time, throws some variety into his syrupy slow rhymes, which is enough to make him look like Biggie Smalls reincarnated next to V-Nasty?s lack of talent and originality. Simplistic beats powered by long-time Gucci collaborator Zaytoven suit him well, and he sounds comfortable on each track. He gets extra points for some of the clever (for him) lines he delivers, such as, ?I?m not romantic but I cook my dope candlelit? (?Out My Circle?). Still, it?s not enough to save BAYTL from being just another unnecessary, forgettable mixtape.
Play this once for the WTF-moments (Gucci: ?You know she gobble on my balls like they crunch n? munch?; V-Nasty: ?No need for a preacher. Pray to me. I?ll be your father?), and then be glad the end of the year is almost over, so we can put this all behind us and forget about it.

Best song: once again, I just don't know. A very even album.

The group's swan song, and it's probably the most fantastic swan song ever recorded. It was indeed a miracle: for a few days (weeks), as if by special consideration, all the quarrels, hatred and bullshit were thrown out and all four did some tight and real co-operative work. Why? Because everybody knew this was the last time.

Despite this, nothing in the world could suffice to make Lennon and McCartney not only make a record together, but write songs together as well. So some of the tracks are definite Lennon, while some are definite McCartney. The record in general produces a very strange feeling - it sounds almost years more mature and aged than the previous album, and when I first heard it I couldn't help wondering: 'THIS is the Beatles?' In the end I only believed that this was the Beatles because no other band alive at the time, not even the Stones, would be able to come up with such an incredible album.

Overall, there is not even a single second on the album which I wouldn't like. Perfection from beginning to end. Then again - few would disagree with this anyway. And the funniest thing is that the Beatles were really always willing to progress - even on their collective deathbed. They could have settled on finishing and polishing the Let It Be album, for instance (see below); instead, they started from scrap and pushed rock music even further in one last, desperate move. Of course I don't mean the use of synthesizers (synthesizers were already used before them by the Byrds and even the Monkees - the only thing in which the latter managed to surpass their prototypes): what I really mean is that they managed to put together an emotional masterpiece. It is quite possible that out of all Beatles albums, this one's the one that really hits your senses as no other does - sadness, anger, joy, childish ridiculousness, melancholy, and awe are all mixed in this terrific package as never before. If The Beatles was their encyclopaedia of pop genres, then Abbey Road is their encyclopaedia of human feelings, which is of course a far more outstanding musical conquest. Buy this album today, and if you don't enjoy it, you're simply not human - there was definitely some bureaucratic error in your personal karma."
pos,"The group disbanded at their peak; whereas most of the contemporaries would linger around and degenerate into self-parody, the Beatles preserved their legendary status by quitting while they were still on top, leaving an untarnished legacy in the annals of rock. Abbey Road is the perfect swansong, displaying each merit of the group in full force. Both emotionally and musically rich, Abbey Road is an incredible album and, in a true testament to the group's brilliance and versatility, is excellent while sounding wholly unique from its predecessors rather than rehashing the same formula time and again. While they were all masterpieces, out of Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sergeant Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, The Beatles and Abbey Road the only two that really explore the same territory are Sgt.P and MMT, thus demonstrating the limitless creativity of the band.

neg,"Lil wayne lost a fan with this album, his performance last night at the vmas was disgraceful .. i dont think i will ever buy another lil wayne album ever."
pos,"One needs only to look at the cover to tell what this album is all about. The bleak look on their faces coupled with the opening trio, ""No Reply"", ""I'm A Loser"", and ""Baby's In Black"" sets the tone right away. ""No Reply"" kicks the album off with John's double tracked growl and a powerfully melancholic wall of guitars. It than kicks into it's aggressive chorus as Paul joins John belting some very high notes and Ringo smashes his cymbals with great power. It only gets more intense as it reaches the bridge where McCartney gets even higher and louder! The two of them serve as excellent foils to each other on this song and ""I'm A Loser"" where McCartney lightens up Lennon's vocals. ""I'm A Loser"" is a blunt and honest song that serves as somewhat of a prelude to ""Help!"" lyrically. 

Their is a large amount of covers on this record. Some of which are excellent like ""Rock n Roll Music"" and ""Honey Don't"" a perfect song for Ringo. I personally don't mind ""Mr. Moonlight"" as I feel it fits the tone of the album and John delivers a great vocal performance. ""Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby"" however is in my opinion one of the worst Beatles recordings. George is poorly double tracked and it's a generally weak song and a low key way to close the album. 

Among the bleak John songs and numerous covers their are some excellent pop gems like ""Eight Days A Week"" and ""I'll Follow The Sun"". Add the single release ""I Feel Fine"" and you've got a nice selection of catchy feel good tunes! ""Eight Days A Week"" is pure Beatles Pop Perfection. 

Beatles For Sale is not a bad album. It contains a lot of gems and serves as an effective document of the effect of Beatlemania on the tired group. This album also paints a very clear picture and puts you into the setting seen on the cover. I hear ""No Reply"" and imagine walking through a park at sunset on a windy Fall's day.
"
pos,"The Beatles album number four BEATLES FOR SALE is better than their first two albums but not as good as the third album A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. As usual there is full of good songs, ""I'm a Loser"", ""Eight Days a Week"", ""Every Little Thing"" etc. Their third album had only their own songs but this album had cover songs, again. I like their covers also but their own songs are so much better. There is good, beautiful melodies and I like the lyrics too."
neg,"At the time this was probably ""genious"", but today it sounds like half finished demoes, and short sketches of what might become something. Most Beatles albums are massively overrated. They may each have contained one or two ""groundbreaking"" songs, but are otherwise boring affairs."
pos,"""Beatles for Sale"" marked the end of the ""boy band"" phase in the Fab Four's development; it was their last album leaning heavily on the crutch of cover songs and original pop tunes, and the last time that country, blues and early rock and roll (the bread and butter of the British Beat scene until the Beatles, Stones and Who went artsy) were the core of their sound, instead of the increasingly diverse mixture of influences to follow. Some of the songs here are great, with Lennon's ""No Reply"" and McCartney's ""I'll Follow the Sun"" being the clearest harbingers of the massive sea change that followed with ""Help!"" and beyond. But some of the stuff here feels like it's filler material designed to keep Beatlemania going while the boys recuperated from an increasingly grueling lifestyle: ""Mr. Moonlight"" was never going to be a great song as an original OR a cover, and ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party"" and ""Baby's in Black"" feel like slightly undercooked early versions of ""I've Just Seen a Face"" and ""Norwegian Wood"" respectively.

The singles, of course, are impeccable: ""Eight Days a Week"" and non-album cut ""I Feel Fine"" both come from these sessions. The Beatles were still cooking, but they admittedly knew they needed a little more time between courses."
pos,"Listened to in hindsight, it's easy now to hear in Beatles For Sale the sound of transition. Of course, from here on out pretty much every Beatles album represented a transition, but in Beatles for Sale one can literally witness both the band that they were (clever pop/rock like ""Eight Days a Week"" matched with Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins covers) and the artists they were becoming (folky tracks like ""Baby's in Black"" and ""I'l Follow the Sun""). The best elements of both sides of the group are the ones I've just mentioned, and some of those are highlights of the Beatles' catalog. But there are also songs which appear to represent the creative slump that comes out of the kind of exhaustion and cynicism that the group might have been experiencing as 1964 drew to a close."
pos,"I don't think this is what The Beatles wanted as their finished project; it also does not help that at the time they were seen as a product to be sold to people. You have hints here and there on what The Beatles were trying to do, but under the circumstances of touring and Beatlemania -- the result was not up to the standard of their earlier works. They have definitely matured a bit, but in the end the album does not come together as well as it could have."
pos,"The Beatles stumbled here despite some experimentation with recording effects and instrumentation, having failed to come up with more than a handful of solid songs by Christmas of 1964 - a de facto deadline imposed by commercial considerations (see title). John did contribute one brilliant, remarkably introspective number (""I'm A Loser""), but the other solid material broke little new ground (""Eight Days A Week""; ""What You're Doing""). In desperation, the band fell back on cover versions of 50s rock standards by Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry, the most memorable being the latter's frantic ""Rock And Roll Music."" None of this could salvage the record, however, and some of the tracks ended up being among the most widely disliked by Beatles fans (""Mr. Moonlight"")."
pos,"While it's a step down from A Hard Day's Night, this is still a great album. Unlike its predecessor, Beatles for Sale features covers (quite a few of them), and the overall mood of the album is much more somber. The opening track ""No Reply"" is a great example of this album's dark mood. The song happens to be one of my favorites on this album though, as it's been called John Lennon's ""first complete story"" in a song. My personal favorite track is ""I'm a Loser"", however. You can sense the Bob Dylan influence in that song, only Lennon was obviously a more talented vocalist. Though those first two songs reflected a very depressed mood, ""Eight Days a Week"" and ""Every Little Thing"" showed that Lennon still had some cheer derspite constantly touring and having very little free time. Paul McCartney contributed a very pretty song in ""I'll Follow the Sun"" and also sang a great cover of ""Kansas City (Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey). I also enjoyed Lennon's covers of "" Rock and Roll Music"" and ""Words of Love"". That's not to say this album had its share of clunkers, though. Lennon didn't do a great job on vocals on the cover of ""Mr. Moonlight"", and the organ solo was plain weird. Ringo's ""Honey Don't"" was overall not an enjoyable song, but I did like George Harrison rocking out on guitar. Speaking of Harrison, he only had one song, a cover of ""Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby"". It wasn't as disappointing as the two songs I mentioned before, but it certainly doesn't live up to Beatles' standards. Overall, this album is still a great listen, and the first two songs are a prime example of Lennon's greatness as a singer and songwriter. However, you can definitely feel the Beatles had some of their energy drained from touring."
pos,"The Beatles fourth album in the u.k. The first three songs have this sad ?? emotion attached to them but really great ???? to listen ???? to them. I like the song "" I'm a Loser"", because john Lennon calls us the listener his friend and in the third verse, he basically telling us in my opinion to always think before you do anything. ""Baby's in Black"" is a bluesy tune that is really great ????. I love ?? their version of ""Words of Love"". So, I think it's a really great album to listen to in the autumn ?? season. My favorite song is ""Words of Love""."
pos,"Ok, first the bad news. The standard six covers are back. Not so much because they didn't have sufficient songs (though who could blame them if that were the case? Two albums a year is hard to do), but partially that they were starting to get really mad at the record company for just trying to get as much money out of them as possible. Hence the For Sale title.

I'm not sure it would be a good idea to listen to this album when you're really down on life, like I am right now, but it might cheer you up to give this a spin a little later and then realize that people have been enduring heartache since the start of time, and that you're not alone. Or something like that. Don't be afraid of this album, even though you'll look at the back and not recognize most of the composers."
pos,"Most people like to pick on Beatles for Sale as their worst album, and while I wouldn't say that, it is certainly a logical choice. But I put it ahead of With the Beatles thanks to a little bit more adventure in their sound, and containing a few classic Beatles songs.

The opening three are the ones everyone starts with, they're all Lennon-McCartney originals and darker than their normal material, which has been interpreted as the weight of being international superstars weighing on the Beatles minds and affecting their musical sound. They're all darker than their normal sound, but I can't say I think they're that strong of a trio of songs. I do love ""I'm a Loser"" despite that I have a hard time singing ""I'm a Loser"" in my car, John just sounds great and gets a great harmonica solo in, showing how this album was getting influenced by one of John's contemporary idols Bob Dylan. ""No Reply' and ""Baby's in Black"" are okay, but I wouldn't call them fantastic anytime soon.

Paul gets his first pure acoustic ballad with ""I'll Follow the Sun"" and as always he has a knack for these songs. It's one of my favorites, and I find it interesting because it was written back in 1960 but was ditched because they thought it was too soft for their hardcore leather jacket image. This gets followed by ""Mr. Moonlight"" which plenty of Beatles critics cite as their worst song. I actually consider it one of the better ones, I loved hearing the Beatles tackle different sounds and genres and ""Mr. Moonlight"" is just such an oddity, especially with that organ solo, I can't help but enjoy it even a little. Plus John gives it another great effort on vocals. After this we get ""Eight Days a Week"" a classic but formulaic Beatle-mania track, still an excellent song though. ""Words of Love"" come next and it's okay, but merely passable. After this the album teeters off, we get mostly covers and basically all of these songs are forgettable. ""I Feel Fine"" would have been a nice addition if they refrained from making that a single, but that's the only song recorded in these sessions that could have aided the album. 

Lots of critics attack it for being a step back from A Hard Day's Night and it certainly was, but I rank my albums based on how good they are, not on how much it fell off from their last effort. So ultimately we're left with a more inconsistent album than With the Beatles, but with better highlights and more interesting elements going on, allowing Beatles for Sale to narrowly escape being crowned as the worst Beatles album."
neg,"I give this album a 4, but then switch it to a 0 because he calls himself the best rapper alive but dropped one of the weakest rap albums of this year. Every song sounds like a filler, and the punchlines sound like a grade 2 made them."
neg,"A terrible album. Wayne's flow is very sluggish and lazy, the beats are too simple and generic, and the wordplay is childish. The only thing keeping me from rating this a 0 is Tech N9ne and Andre 3000 killing the interlude and the possibility that this could be his last album."
neg,"I simply do not understand what is so great about Lil Wayne. His voice is horrible (probably because of all the drugs he likes to use), and it is unbearable to have to listen through one of his songs. Surely there must be a more deserving and better artist to spend your money on, right?"
neg,"Just plain terrible. To be fair, I've never been a big Wayne fan, but these are the most uninventive lyrics I've heard from him yet, and the beats (which were fantastic on Tha Carter III) are TERRIBLE. The only redeeming qualities are that 6'7"" is an awesome club song, and a few guests are worth listening to, like Jadakiss, t3ch 9ine, Nas, and Andre."
neg,"i use to love lil wayne, untill i heard this peice of poo of an album... what is this? its just hurting my ears. i just wanna call lil wayne and say SHUT UP YOU RAP TOO MUCH BULLSHEE IN THIS ALBUM. also carter 3 was 20times better thanks.

BWAAAAAAANNNGGGGG!!!!

Now that that's settled, this is Beatlemania and all its glory in a nutshell. It's a very short album (30 minutes) but that removes it of any filler, never leaving room for a dull moment. We get a couple of ballads, but for the most part we get lots of high energy numbers.

There's the classic intro, ""A Hard Day's Night"", with its legendary opening chord played by George on his 12-string, and some nice back and forth with Paul and John before having an equally epic guitar fade out at the end. The energy doesn't die as we get the best harmonica in the Beatles career with ""I Should Have Known Better"". John launches into a ballad after this with ""If I Fell"", which seems much more like Paul's wheelhouse rather than John but it works here, John would largely avoid these Paul-esque songs for the majority of his tenure with the Beatles. We also get the underrated ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" another quick tempo rocker, I love listening to George's moments and he continues to shine here.

Then we get ""And I Love Her"" which is another classic Beatles song, the choice for Ringo to play bongos instead of drums is absolutely exquisite and apparently it was George who came up with the opening guitar part that Paul would later claim ""was the song"" on George's autobiography (Living in the Material World). Paul was always an expert at ballads and while sometimes it would get overdone this is the first time Paul pulls it off perfectly. Not as good as ""Yesterday"" but a fantastic precursor. John follows this with the decent ""Tell Me Why"" which is in my opinion the weakest moment of the otherwise flawless first half, but Paul picks things up again with ""Can't Buy Me Love"". The latter song features some excellent drum work by Ringo.

I will say however that in my opinion the first half is much stronger than the second half, or at the least there's less classic Beatles material. We do still get ""Anytime at All"" which has a fantastic tempo, but even better than this are the more low-key songs that probably weren't happy or sweet enough to make it into the movie. The two to highlight are ""Things We Said Today"" and ""I'll Be Back"" as they both manage to strike a middle between fast pace and slow ballad that makes them stand out against the other Beatlemania tracks. The only track that this album probably would have been better without is ""I'll Cry Instead"" which the clumsy lyrics kind of kill for me, they're a little too downtrodden for a song with such a happy tempo, but I'm nitpicking as even this song isn't all that bad.

I've kind of been repeating myself but that's because A Hard Day's Night has very similar songs in many aspects, most are all fast paced, good rockers, great harmonies, just perfect Beatlemania. If you're any kind of music fan you need to listen to this, and the movie is pretty good too."
neg,"its time for Lil Wayne to retire from rap. Dude's unstable mental state due to heavy drug use is stopping him from delivering a decent/solid effort. The Carter 3 made me a Lil Wayne fan but everything since then has been in the range from disappointing to straight trash. To date, this is the worst Lil Wayne album. Most of us that true rap fans can see straight through this weak attempt that still tries to establish Weezy as the best rapper alive. With the corniest punchlines I've ever heard this year all being rolled up into one album Weezy is definitely feeling himself way too much. Also the song with Drake and Jada is laughable. Going at Jigga is probably the worst career move he can do at this time. That man was a selling factor for he both Drake and Weezy on their best albums to date. Morons!!!

I try to see some good to this album but it doesn't stem from Weezy at all. The Interlude with Tech N9ne and Andre 3000 as well as the second one with Bun B, Busta, Nas & Shyne are the two best tracks on the entire album. ""C'mon sahn"", was these two even meant to be on the album? They don't fit at all and makes Weezy look dumb on his own **** I think ""She Will"" and ""Nightmares from the Bottom"" may give him some radio play but with the album having 19 cuts with the deluxe version I can only recommend four tracks giving worth a listen. I know some will say he can do better but honestly i don't think he can. Wrap it up son, take care of your kids and pass the mic to someone that's hungry and wants to make dope music, As far being the best alive, Jay-Z has that tied down, if you're still rapping at that age and make a solid album like Watch The Throne then maybe I might actually buy another one of Lil Wayne's albums."
neg,"Well this was pointless, Lil Wayne should've made this a mixtape instead of getting rich off of this shit The production is boring and cliched, the concept is nothing new, and the lyrics are just a mix of metaphors and similes anyone can think of. How to Love was surprisingly the best one. I think it's selfish dissing Beyonce and Jay-Z over money. Get real Lil Wayne, I don't care if you are hard-working, it seems you haven't worked hard enough"
neg,"Fuck Lil Wayne. He was already the most overrated rapper in the history of rap, but this album made me want to throw up. The album is just flat out lazy. At least during his mixtape run several years back he was working his ass off. It's pretty pathetic that for he turned in this crap after all the hype for the Carter IV. There isn't one... repeat NOT ONE.... good song on this fucking album. His beats are generic, but his lyrics are even worse. His metaphors and wordplay are as elementary as they come. This album is just as often R&B as it is rap, and both aspects are shit. For a guy to call himself the best rapper alive, he better just stick to rap. Nobody wants to hear his crooning bullshit, but I guess that's what happens when you allow artists such as Drake and T-Pain on your album. The best song on this album is the track with Andre 3000 and Tech Nine, and it's funny because Lil Wayne isn't even on that song. I've realized that all of Waynes music is geared towards one age demographic. 12-18. If you're older than that and you like this album than you have no dignity. I will never listen to another Wayne song again, and I almost feel ashamed that I ever liked him to begin with. To hell with this corny fake a$$ poser. Go read the review from the Big Ghost Chronicles. If you hate this album as much as I do, you'll be grinning from ear to ear just reading it"
neg,"You have to be mentally unstable to listen to this album. First of all, lil wayne sings too much, when he shouldn't at all. His voice is so unbearable I'd rather watch spiderman 3 on replay. His flow has become so bad, I think Nicholas Cage can act better then that. I only give it a one because the outro and the interlude are good. YOU KNOW WHY? BECUASE LIL WAYNE ISNT IN THEM AT ALL."
neg,Its crap that is gonna sell regardless. He used to be soo good at rapping. bummer. He just spit lazy lines with no energy. the best song was by Tech 9ne and Andre 3000. the only reason he put Shyne on the album was so he would at least out-shine one person on his album.
neg,"AS a french who understand a bit english this album is full of Weak punchline overused rhymes the album even with an intro interlude and outro doesn't got any ""coharence"" but we can expect a great success worldwide because they""re is so many people who doesn't speak and understand English but lil Wayne slowly getting old sorry for my french"
neg,"Well I'm a Little Weyne fan but i must say, this is pretty shit awful. Where oh where has my Little Weyne gone, where oh where can he be. Is he under my bed? Is he inside my closet? Is he in mothers room? My search for Little Wheeziyena has not been successful in the least sense. You can call it, unsuccessful. Yes yes, very bad indeed. But i shall end this with a goodbye, and perhaps a future hello. Hello, Goodbye. My name is Karim, who are you? Little Weyne? Wheezi? Exactly who art thou? Pleasure to meet you Dweyne "
neg,"Really disappointed by this album. I thought Tha Carter series was supposed to be his flagship, tentpole, ""if-you-listen-to-nothing-else-I-do-listen-to-these"" albums. If I wanted boring, formulaic beats, nondescript rhymes, and no energy...I would've bought or listened to one of his 10,000 mixtapes. But that's what this is. I've listened to this album three times now, and I can't remember any of the tracks on it other than 6 Foot 7 Foot and John--the singles before the album came out. The rest is just...tired and formulaic. And that's something I never expected to say about Weezy."
neg,"When you thought he couldn't get any worse, he does. Lil Wayne is just a disgrace to hip-hop now. The saddest thing is that this terrible album will sell millions and he'll make another one. ""If I die today, remember me like John Lennon"". I can't listen to this without laughing. The worse thing is that line is from one of the least horrible songs on the album."
neg,"i use to love lil wayne, untill i heard this peice of poo of an album... what is this? its just hurting my ears. i just wanna call lil wayne and say SHUT UP YOU RAP TOO MUCH BULLSHEE IN THIS ALBUM. also carter 3 was 20times better thanks."
neg,"Lil Wayne did a horrible job on Tha Carter 4...it does not even closely match the level of Tha Carter 3 in quality. You would think after a year in jail he would have something else to talk about or have hundreds of great raps to spit...but no. His lyrics are nothing new, his flow is average, the beats are forgettable and generic and overall it is a bad experience"
neg,"After spending time in jail, some do better, some do worse. Unfortunately in order to balance out MVicks success out of jail the universe has chosen Wayne aka ""The greatest rapper alive"" to be on the worse side. With few high points in the album, its hard to see why so many people defend him. Many rap fans and wayne fans were put off by ""How to love"",(The worst song by anyone in a long time) but gave him a chance to make up with some hopefully hard tracks to bob your head to. Well unfortunately my head bobbed about 4 times, one of those is to ""Outro"" which doesn't even have Wayne on the track. The issues i have with this cd is the way it feels when you play it. It seems like your listening to the exact same song for 9 hours; the tracks play slow, the cd has little flow to it. What usually saves Wayne are his lyrics, which is what he's known for. ""How you ni**as want it? have it your way, Burger King"" The Lyrics are just so lame. Another issue is what the hell is his name? Weezy? Wayne? Birdman Jr? Tunchi? I feel like the arrogance of Wanye has caught up to him, as he feels his name alone will sell albums, and sadly it will. But Tha Carter III was a good album, better overall flow, more good than bad songs, but on this album, its just not there. Everyone defending him because they are ""real fans"" can stop, he has money(as he mentions in every song) so he doesn't need everyone to defend a bad album. And please stop saying he's trying something new, because he did that already with his ""rock"" album. Do what made you millions. Talented yes, Tha Carter IV good? no. this album has very little replay value, and for just 4 maybe 5 decent tracks, ill save my old money"
pos,"THE BEATLES: Black US R&B, Soul & Rock and Roll + Euro Folk Melodies & Inventive Chords = ROCK MUSIC"
pos,"The bummer flipside to Hard Day's, this album is almost identical in style (mid-60's jangle-pop, with slight incursions from blues, country, soul, and croon) to that one, but where's all the goofy happiness gone to? Lookit those sad sack motherfuckers on the record jacket! All these songs are about losing your love and being a loser yerself! Who farted in their collective faces this morning? Well slap my ass and call me The Midnight Cowboy but these Beatle boys were good at what they did. They can even make feeling shitty sound, well, like something you can write really great catchy songs about."
pos,"A 'marking-time album', I presume the expression is? Lack of easily detectable forward movement and all? Yes, the Beatles were tired and somewhat disspirited (at least, John and George certainly were, as it's their grumbling and bickering rather than Paul's or Ringo's that fills up much of the corresponding period as decribed in the Anthology). Tired of touring; disspirited through being so heavily pressed down upon by the whole business. Logically thinking, there's no way such a situation could not have affected their songwriting, and the drab autumnal colours and unusually scruffy haircuts (doesn't George's, in particular, look like it's begging to be grabbed by that strand and lifted off in one sweep?) seem to comply with that idea.

In any case, it's interesting to see the tendency: the further the band progresses, the more they try to get away from covering material by contemporary artists and the more they concentrate on the music of their teenage days. And the better results they get, because clearly, rock'n'roll material was far closer to their spirit than Motown, no matter the quality of the recording. Proof? The sixth cover - 'Mr Moonlight', arguably one of the, if not the weakest link in the band's entire catalog. It's not that there's anything badly wrong with the performance; it's just that there's nothing particularly interesting about it. Might as well have been done by Manfred Mann or an even more faceless outfit of the epoch. With an arrangement and a pace so lacklustre, John's hoarse wailing in the middle-eight only makes matters worse. Come to think of it, maybe that is why Beatles For Sale is so often given the cold shoulder? Just because it's got the most boring Beatles track ever on it?"
pos,"This is the least cohesive of all The Beales 13 original UK albums despite the transitionary phase of 'Help!', the seperation of 'The Beatles' and the entirely lacklustre effort of 'Let It Be'.
The discovery of Bob Dylan in the confessions and open hearts of 'I'm a loser' and 'Baby's in black' serve only to make dated covers like 'Mr Moonlight' and 'Everybody's trying to be my baby' sound like the fillers that The Beatles worked so hard to avoid in their first three albums. Despite the obvious burst of energy all members showed for 'Rock n roll music', it still serves only as a reminder that the maturing of the band was rush released for christmas with six 'fab' versions of six old hits.
The soul baring of Lennons first confessions, ('I'm a loser'/'I don't want to spoil the party'), the emergent melodys of McCartneys first 'pop above rock' tracks ('I'll follow the sun'/'What you're doing') are put in bare contrast to the rock'n'rolling band that recorded 'Please please me', with half hearted covers of songs that influenced them to take to the stage mixed baldly into songs from a dawning era that would lead to its' peak in 'Sgt Pepper'.
Ultimately this album still contains more than its' fair share of classics ('No reply'/'Eight days a week'/'Every little thing') and in any other bands' repetoire would stand as a true breakthrough.
This isn't any other band, it's The Beatles rushing a change for the christmas market and stands only as their weakest testament."
pos,"That one silly pop masterpiece to top all other silly pop masterpieces, you know.

Best song: I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER

Another major breakthrough for the band - a record consisting of nothing but Lennon-McCartney originals. They weren't exactly the first to do this, but arguably they were the first who could not only boast a collection of original songs that large, but also prove that all of them were, in fact, originals, rather than stolen R'n'B compositions with re-written lyrics (a practice that so often marred the work of their competitors). Not that the boys ever made a fuss of it themselves, or had their promoters put a heavy emphasis on this aspect. They didn't need it.

A Hard Day's Night is certainly the culmination of the ""early"" Beatles - still unburdened by 'heavyweight' musical matters and at the same time reaching absolute perfection in the 'lightweight' spheres. But the funny thing is, at least, according to my impressions, that it actually took them to achieve this kind of perfection in order for the entire proceedings to start looking a little ""fake"". In a way, the album is just too damn perfect. In a way, Please Please Me comes across as sort of more natural-sounding, if you get my drift. It's pretty obvious that the Beatles were getting too big for this kind of britches, putting way too much effort into songs that, in all honesty, didn't really deserve it (hence the occasionally annoying disparity between melody and lyrics). And it's not like I'm turning my nose at simple pop songs or anything - it's just that there's always scope, and there's always a pool of talent, and then they meet like the proverbial Aristotelian form and substance, and in this here case there's too much substance for too little form. Which, provided, is still way better than the opposite. But which also means there'd be a good direction for improvement."
pos,"If I ever had a gun to my head on the subject, I would probably say this is the greatest ""pure pop"" album of all time (or at least that I've heard). It's another album of early 60's poppy guitar rock, and there's little on the album that would qualify as ""rock"" in any definition based in post-'65 music. Furthermore, there's pretty much no genre experimentation on the album, and doesn't possess much in the way of innovative qualities. Yet the album is amazing, making its claim to greatness simply from containing one amazing pop song after another. Anybody who has any doubts about whether it's worth it to get into the band's early work simply must give this a listen; one listen could wipe all those doubts away. Not only did this album wipe away all of those doubts, I also credit it with making me understand what exactly a ""hook"" is. The album is absolutely overflowing with hooks, the kind that are so strong and so well-written that every instinct of good taste and enjoyment makes me focus all of my attention on the songs here.

Anyways, this album is denied a perfect score because a.) When I Get Home is somewhat dumb, b.) the album is only a hair over 30 minutes long, and c.) I enjoy Rubber Soul slightly more than this album, but I feel RS is only an 5 stars as well. REGARDLESS, however, you need this album. PERIOD. Get it today.
"
pos,"Like all Beatles albums, there's nothing but skilled craftsmanship and beautiful songwriting. But in the context of the rest of The Beatles' discography, this is probably one of their more standard releases. It's fun the whole way through, however, and Eight Days A Week is easily one of their very best songs for me."
pos,"The Beatles released their latest official long-player, Beatles for Sale, in England on December 4 of 1964, capping a year of the most extraordinary activity ever seen on the part of a performing group. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., where sales were easily dwarfing the group's U.K. success by sheer weight of numbers, Capitol Records saw no reason to give 14 new songs to the waiting public, especially as they were sitting on one leftover song from the U.K. A Hard Day's Night album, and had a current single whose two sides, ""I Feel Fine"" and ""She's a Woman,"" they could use to promote whatever they released. The result was Beatles '65, issued a little less than two weeks before the start of that year and ten days before Christmas. This was the first U.S. album on which the commingling of tracks started to wear on the originals. (The Beatles' Second Album had been a miraculous assembly of material from nearly a half-dozen sessions and sources, while Something New was basically the Hard Day's Night soundtrack without ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" but punched up with a pair of hard-rocking covers.) Beatles '65 was essentially the core of the rather dour Beatles for Sale, punched up with the new single and an offbeat but killer remnant from A Hard Day's Night. While it all sounded OK and duly topped the charts, the cohesion was starting to get lost; between the acoustic-textured Beatles for Sale numbers and the feedback-laden ""I Feel Fine,"" the hard-rocking ""She's a Woman,"" and the somewhat less sharp-edged Carl Perkins covers here, there was less and less method to the compiling for the U.S. This came courtesy of Dave Dexter, Jr., a Capitol executive who'd had to be ordered to start authorizing the release of Beatles material by Capitol in America (as opposed to passing on it and letting other licensees handle it), and seemingly spent most of the next two years trying to prove how right he'd been to neglect them. The odd thing was that, despite the weak and odd recouplings of songs, the album did sell, and song for song it was still better than anything the competition was creating -- as long as the singles were everything they should be, the band was on safe ground. With this and its next release, Capitol was starting to figure out just how valuable each Beatles song was by itself, and how far they could go repackaging them, as long as they retained some measure of common sense. They lost that attribute with the U.S. Help! album, courtesy of Dexter, but in the meantime the label did get out flawed if entertaining compilations such as this."
pos,"The only Capital Beatles album I'd recommend over the import, but only on the strength of side 2. If there ever was a Beatles import that needed track re--sequencing, it was ""Beatles for sale"". The clustering of three songs in the same emotional mode, in similar keys, and with the first song starting mid sentence and the second one leading off with a big, attention getting vocal motif shows how misguided the Beatles first change of gear was. Better to lead it off with ""I feel fine"" if not ""I'm a loser"". The lone carry over from ""A hard day's night"", ""I'll be back"" serves just fine as a follow up to ""Honey don't"". Sonically this track works well with both ""She's a woman"" ""I feel fine"" and the closer ""Everybody's trying to be my baby"". It's interesting to note that the sequencing of side 2 of the upcoming ""Help!"" was very similar to the layout of side 2 here; 2 oldies interpolating a side of originals. I've often wondered if the Beatles looked at ""Beatles '65"" and thought ""Let's do up side 2 like this"". Buy it for side 2, re-shuffle side 1. If you have ""Beatles anthology, vol. 1"" slip in the track ""Leave my Kitten alone"" in the place of ""Mr. Moonlight""; it will give the album an extra kick in the ass!"
pos,"The lastÿBeatlesÿalbum to be recorded (althoughÿLet It Beÿwas the last to be released),ÿAbbey Roadwas a fitting swan song for the group, echoing some of the faux-conceptual forms ofÿSgt. Pepper, but featuring stronger compositions and more rock-oriented ensemble work. The group was still pushing forward in all facets of its art, whether devising some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record (especially on ""Because""), constructing a medley of songs/vignettes that covered much of side two, adding subtle touches of Moog synthesizer, or crafting furious guitar-heavy rock (""The End,"" ""I Want You (She's So Heavy),"" ""Come Together"").ÿGeorge Harrisonÿalso blossomed into a major songwriter, contributing the buoyant ""Here Comes the Sun"" and the supremely melodic ballad ""Something,"" the latter of which became the firstÿHarrison-pennedÿBeatlesÿhit. WhetherÿAbbey Roadÿisÿthe Beatles' best work is debatable, but it's certainly the most immaculately produced (with the possible exception ofÿSgt. Pepper) and most tightly constructed."
pos,"Actually the last album recorded by The Beatles, the disintegrating band called a ceasefire on hostilities to record this last love letter to each other and to the world. Lush, rich, smooth, epic, emotional and utterly gorgeous, it is my personal favourite Beatles album. It?s got a big, modern sound, swollen by judicious use of a prototype Moog synthesiser and harmonies multi-tracked to choral dimensions. It?s got style (the slinky, bass-tastic groove of Lennon?s sly, post-hippy anthem 'Come Together?), it?s got heart (Harrison?s spine-tingling ballad 'Something?), it?s got rock and roll ('Oh Darling? features McCartney?s most blistering vocal and a stinging rhythm guitar), it?s got a monster rock mantra ('I Want You (She?s So Heavy)?) and it concludes with a dazzling, epic 16 minute medley of gorgeous song snatches, leaving us with the breathless conclusion 'and in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.? They took a lot of love with them as they set off on their solo journeys, and it?s a love that still resonates today."
pos,"One of the most impressive things about this album to me is its restraint. What do I mean by that? The Moog Synthesizer had just come out at the time of this album's recording, and these fellas knew that it would be a huge mistake to just go nuts and plant synth lines into every song. Had this been a lesser group, this may have led to a disastrous, synth indulgent album, but the gang knew how to use the Moog tastefully, without overwhelming the songs. ""Here Comes the Sun"" might be the best example of this. The synth lines appear subtely, complementing the melody, and then brighten up gradually during the chorus for an added texture of warmth. It's a seemingly minor detail in an album filled with typical Beatles imagination, but it's one that really stands out as a testament to their genius to me.ÿ"
pos,"Although it would be released before LET IT BE, ABBEY ROAD was actually the last album The Beatles would ever record. In terms of theme & construction, the album sounds very much like a sequel to their landmark album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, especially during the final medley section of the album. It was certainly a return to form after the relatively less focused (but no less brilliant) WHITE ALBUM sessions. 

What differentiates ABBEY ROAD from SGT. PEPPER'S in my mind is the maturity and confidence each of the individual members seem to have at this point in their career. The performances are all quite strong and arrangements (thanks in part to George Martin) are so carefully considered & gracefully executed. 

Unlike the other musical geniuses (namely Jimi, Janis & Jim) we would lose by 1972 due to ""death by misadventure"", The Beatles were split by interpersonal acrimony & business differences. John, Paul, George & Ringo would each attain some level of personal & creative success after the breakup, but none of their individual achievements would ever equal the sum of their parts. ABBEY ROAD is a testament to my assertion and a perfect coda to their unsurpassed contributions to popular music."

Carter IV sucks and there is no arguing that. YMCMB=trash

Yh he can get some big names to rap with him, but that doesn't matter when lil wayne ruins every song with his vocals and slow and uninspiring rapping. Most disappointing rap album of the year."
neg,"Lil Wayne took a major dip quality wise from his past work. If you compare both Carter 2 and Carter 4 you can see how much he's fallen off. The beats are something like what one would hear on I Am Not A Human Being but the punchlines and lyrical ability from the artist is where i lost interest in the project. It's sad to say the best tracks on the record are the one the creator of the album isn't even on. Have fun watching the throne Mr. Tunechi, you need to get schooled on hip-hop again"

neg,"This album isn't dope nor is it very fresh -- in both senses of the word. Seems like I've heard this before, oh yes I have, on the radio. Just a bunch of shallow songs that just beg for airplay, that's it. Wayne uses his mixtapes to get his creativity out, and he uses his albums to remain the cash cow that he is. Simple as that."

neg,"wow!! this is a album from a rapper who call himself the king of hip hop. i am amazed at the poor quality of this album. with songs as poor as how to hate, this album is total. worst CARTER ever. i used to admire lil wayne but not after this album. i thought carter 4 would be the best rap album of 2011 but i was wrong. hell the sequel is still the best rap album on my list."
neg,"Lil Wayne is, by far, the worst rapper of all time. I cannot even fathom how he is so popular and how people find him so appealing. I listened to this garbage-tier album solely on the premise of wanting to hear his other collaborators like Bustah, Andre, and Tech (Arguably three of the best in the industry); and I wasn't disappointed by their performances, but as soon as Wayne's banshee like voice started to screech out in the track, I was immediately overtaken by the sensation of wanting to gouge my eyes with a pen knife just so my mind would be distracted from what I was hearing... it was honestly that bad. Long story short, garbage rapper makes garbage album. If you really want to get your rap fix, pick up some Bustah Rhymes or Tech N9ne, or Mos Def, or somebody that's not Lil Wayne. You'll thank me later"

I dont like lil wayne but Tha Carter II is one of my favorite albums of all time. If lil wayne can go back to those days I'll start comparing him to artists lil Eminem, Nas, Jay-Z, Kanye & Canibus"
neg,"Oops. The Beatles had quietly broken up before their final album was released, the soundtrack to a rather disheartening documentary, in which the discomfort between the principle players is all too apparent. A slightly sad postscript, there are still monster tunes here by anyone else?s standards, but it lacks sonic clarity, and is peppered with under-developed, sub-standard blues. Lennon is the guiltiest party, and his turgid 'Dig A Pony? is embarrassing, although he almost redeems himself with the strange beauty of 'Across The Universe?. Clearly trying to rally the troops, McCartney leads them through a number of frankly under-developed pub rockers, but then knocks everyone for six with two epic, soulful ballads, 'Let It Be? and 'The Long And Winding Road?. It is the only official Beatles album without a Ringo lead vocal, and the strange thing is that things get so bad, you actually miss it. Phil Spector?s shiny post-production doesn?t help, and the McCartney driven release of the original tapes as 'Let It Be ? Naked? in 2003 is a genuine improvement."
pos,"I don't think I would call this the Beatles best album because of a couple of rather trivial throwaway tracks on side 1, but side 2 is the greatest thing ever committed to vinyl by a rock and roll band. The most remarkable feature is the sheer volume of brilliant ideas developed briefly, then abandoned for new explorations. With almost dizzying speed the band reveals their priceless musical gems, only to toss them almost casually aside and move on. Ideas that this band develops for less than 2 minutes would, for any ordinary rock band, be the highlight not only of an album, but even a career, something to be turned into an opus and stretched out to marathon length. That this band had so many moments of inspiration is an incredible testament to their creativity, and the main reason why they were not just the greatest rock band that ever has been, but the best there ever could be. The genre, and our culture, has changed so much since the Beatles heyday that the phenomenon that they became, both artistically and culturally, can never be equalled again."
pos,"Easily one of the greatest Rock albums of all time. There is so much variety of musical styles on this album. So many great and memorable songs. The Beatles were all better musicians by the time they recorded this album and it shows. It's scary to think of how primitive their equipment was compared to the gear we have today and yet their music still sounds great. But the musical ideas was where these boys excelled. Strong writing and execution along with help from George Martin. For all the talk about how influential Revolver was, the music was much better on this album. It's an argument I have fought with all my life when it comes to music. Is an album great because it may be more influential or is the album that is not as influential but contains the better music greater?"
pos,"Abbey Road was the last album recorded by the Beatles, though oddly Let it Be was not released until a year after this. In essence, this is the Beatles' swan song. And what a way to go out! When I gave the album its first serious listen years back, what struck me initially was that this was the Beatles telling the world that it could handle the litany of musical styles with aplomb, parading each in their grandeur throughout Abbey Road. It was Lennon and McCartney boldly declaring by sampling each that they could've expanded on any of those modes of music if they had wanted to, basically flaunting their unmatched versatility for 47 minutes straight. In other words, they took their already epic 8-year career and somehow upped the ante on their way out the door. The stuff of pure legends.

Abbey Road isn't perfect, but side two is awfully close, and side one is still very good. The second set starts off with a bang as ""Here Comes the Sun"" ? a pristine pop tune in its own right ? pours out of the speakers with the elegance of a sparkling waterfall. Then ""Because"" comes along to remind us that the Fab Four has the mellow ballad end of the spectrum covered quite aptly. From there we go on an unparalleled mesmerizing ride through every possible emotion all the way to the conclusion of the album, and in the end there are no survivors ? and yet everyone's better for the experience.

Of all the great Beatles albums, Abbey Road is the most impressive. It's also the 2nd best album of all-time. Not bad for an end-of-career effort, not bad at all... The only remaining question at this point was whether the Beatles all had capes and were going to fly off into the sunset."
pos,"Full of amazing and unforgettable tunes, Abbey Road is a must own by not just Beatles lovers, but music fans in general."
pos,"The final album recorded by the Beatles, as John Lennon had mentioned he ""wanted a divorce"" a couple of weeks before Abbey Road hit the record store shelves. It's mostly a three-piece affair, as John Lennon had taken a withdrawn role in the group by this time.

""Come Together"" was the most substantial track Lennon had contributed to the album, and the song itself came about as a retread of Chuck Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me""; indeed, this would result in a lawsuit by that song's publisher that Lennon would later settle out of court in part by making his ""Rock and Roll"" solo album five years later. ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" only has three lines of lyrics over nearly 8 minutes. He does have one moment of true brilliance, the vocal showcase ""Because"" with rich triple-tracked harmonies by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison; in a matter of perspective to their eventual breakup, the song's vocals were cut in one of the last sessions for the album. Paul McCartney's contributions aren't much better, although ""Oh! Darling"" sounds like a dreamy rock oldie chestnut. George Harrison's two contributions are worth the price of admission alone; ""Something"", his first Beatles A-side single, and ""Here Comes the Sun"", are two of the best songs he ever contributed to the band, and possibly his two best ever compositions. Whether by accident or design, they helped set the table for his enormously successful ""All Things Must Pass"" one year later.

But it's the production values that really make Abbey Road. The medley that makes up the bulk of Side 2 (on the vinyl configuration) is nothing more than a triumph of production thanks to McCartney and producer George Martin. Most of the medley are vignettes and incomplete songs written the previous year in India and rejected from the White Album and Let It Be sessions. But Abbey Road does stand as arguably one of their best and slickest produced albums, the summation of years of experimentation and perfection culminating in this final effort. And even if the Beatles were breaking up, they were still pushing themselves forward here; nothing even the best production could hide if they weren't at least trying. Even on ""Come Together"" McCartney's thick, swampy bass, Lennon's tight rhythm playing and Ringo Starr's intricate, precise drumming make the track a stunning ensemble showcase. And Harrison's Moog synthesizer adds the right touches to the songs (notably ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and ""Here Comes the Sun"") without becoming overbearing.

So this was the end of the road. Most consider Abbey Road as the way to go out instead of Let It Be; if that's how you choose to view it, then they couldn't have ended on a better note; a full summary of everything they'd learned up until now. And for awhile, would carry into their respective solo careers."
pos,"I regret Let it Be was the Beatles 'final offering'. Abbey Road as Beatles fans know was their final recording as a band.

It is slick & cool. 

The musicianship impresses. Harmonies everywhere, ballads, rockers, orchestrations & even an early Moog synthesizer.

(Let it Be should have been a single as well as Get Back & Long & Winding Road. The Let it Be album was disappointing with rare glimpses of brilliance). 

Here comes the Sun to this day evokes optimism & possibility as a Beatles fan & as a person. If you heard this in 1969 you would have looked forward to a new decade with The Beatles at the helm. 'Sun' along with Something (both Harrison songs) hinted that George would be a new powerful writing force within The Beatles.

IMHO it is the best produced album since Pepper & a return to form for everyone including George Martin.

The cover alone has become as iconic if not more than Peppers. I shunned Abbey Road along with Let it Be for years but I rediscovered it a few years ago and I have fallen in love with it again."
pos,"The last of the BIG 5 albums (others were RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, PEPPER, WHITE ALBUM) ABBEY ROAD isn't definitely their easiest album. It took me some time to understand its beauty and complexity. There's great songs, ""Here Comes the Sun"" as the finest one. But also ""Come Together"", ""Something"" and ""Carry That Weight"" are classics. In fact, I though that this was one of their worst albums until I took a chance a listened to it couple more times."
pos,"I'm as big a Beatles fan as there is, but I'm trying to be objective when it comes to 'Abbey Road'. The album has earned its reputation based on the awe-inspiring, jaw dropping perfection of the medley on side two, but there is a fact about this record that simply can't be denied: side one is mediocre at best and very uneven. Yes, it starts out with the brilliance of ""Come Together"" (which may be the funkiest track the Beatles ever recorded) and George's ravishing love song, ""Something"". But it then goes straight downhill without remorse. ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" gets my nomination for the worst song the Beatles ever recorded, ""Oh ! Darling"" attempts to be a '50's-style belter, but McCartney's vocals are distinctly inferior to earlier band recordings in the same style such as ""I'm Down"" and their frentic cover of Little Richard's ""Long Tall Sally"". ""Octopuss' Garden"" is a feeble re-write of ""Yellow Submarine"", and as far as ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" is concerned...well, with a song constructed around a single verse that says ""I want you/I want you so bad babe/I want you/I want you so bad...it's driving me mad, it's driving me mad"", heck, AC/DC could have written it.

Ahh...but then, George's bright, sunny acoustic guitar rings out for the beginning of side two with ""Here Comes the Sun"", and all is right in the world again. You then proceed to get what is perhaps the finest single side of an album that any rock band has ever produced. So to call 'Abbey Road' a schizophrenic record is pretty much on target. Basically, what you have here is roughly 70% pure brilliance and 30% pure dross. So does that still qualify it as a great album ? Yes it does, but it's definitely a flawed one."
pos,"this album is masterpiece and The Beatles were only one of a few bands who were great till the end. most bands put out bad last records not this band ! .John Lennon's Songs are great as always Come Together is a classic but i love I Want You She's So Heavy a great heavy rock song .and Because is one of the most beautiful songs with three part harmony singing which shows how good John Paul and George sounded together on.Pauls songs he comes up with Oh Darling which is one of his best vocals ever very soulful ,Maxwells Silver Hammer is okay not one of his best,You Never Give Me Your Money and Carry That Weight have great melodies. also on this album George Harrison starts coming up with great songs. Here Comes The Sun and Something which is one of the best love ballads ever written .Ringo's song is enjoyable as well. a great way to end one of the greatest bands in music history."
pos,"Amazing beyond words, that's what this one is. As much as I adore Revolver and The White Album, this one has them both beaten in one very important way - it absolutely crushes you emotionally. Not just the lyrics, of course, but the way they are sung and the music that accompanies them (especially the Martin production) simply pull your guts out and stomp them like nothing else. Of course, this might have something to do with the fact that they all REALLY hated each other by this time, and the emotions were flowing like mad, but whatever. Of course, in a way, that in itself is a bit of flaw, and is why I don't give it the nod of the band's best (though it gets an overall 16 easily) - if you aren't feeling steady emotionally, this album can hit you so hard that you will feel off-kilter for hours afterwards. In other words, it's harder to listen to five consecutive times than, say, Revolver. Other than that, though, no complaints.

I really don't know what else to say. NO band has ever had a better swan-song than this (and yes, I'm aware that to make that statement in full confidence, I'd have to have heard the last albums of every band ever, but this album is sufficiently good that I feel I can say it within a really freaking wide confidence interval), and I doubt that will ever change. If you don't like it ... well, I'm sorry, but I just won't be ever to fully understand you."
pos,"Abbey Road is the last flash of brilliance from the Beatles, and it encompasses all facets of what they had done together over the past decade. Maybe the strongest part of Abbey Road was the fact the band played together like they hadn't played since the days of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. There is so much on these songs, John's jamming and growing interests in the political scene, Paul's word craft, George's spirituality and burgeoning songwriting, and Ringo's humor. I'm glad the Beatles gave us this to remember them by, and the music speaks to us even now. Each track is a slice of each man and as with Pepper, to remove one track would take away from the majesty that were the Beatles, therefore all tracks are essential."
pos,"There is no doubt that Abbey Road is the masterpiece of The Beatles and that surpasses any of his previous works of the band, including Sgt. Pepper's, thanks to its exquisite production, orchestrations and experimentation with Moog synthesizers."
pos,"Writing about how life changing The Beatles were (are - it seems) is probably as necessary as needing...another Beatles. 
The tie for my second favorite Beatles album is Rubber Soul and Revolver. They run 2a and 2b depending on my mood, but either are startling, groundbreaking and still sound fresh today. 
Abbey Road is, and has always been, my favorite Beatles album. Side Two, except for the totally superfluous Her Majesty, is probably my favorite stretch of music on any album, ever. Even though it was released before Let It Be it is rather poetic that the best band in the world recorded their best music as their farewell gift to us all."
pos,"Actually the last album they ever recorded together. Let It Be was released later but recorded earlier. Don't worry, those kind of details don't matter that much. What does matter is that the Beatles were definitely in the advanced stages of busting apart at this time, and therefore there is a lot, and I mean a lot, of fragmentation on this record. While previously Beatles records were divided into John songs, Paul songs, John and Paul songs, and sometimes George songs, now the John and Paul songs are no more. If you need more of those, check out Let It Be, because there isn't any of it here. Also, George has so come into his own 100% by now. So much so that his songs are almost the best on the record. And, well, Ringo plays a mean drum, as usual.

Song by song because I'm not feeling very creative: We kick off with John's stripped psycho-rocker 'Come Together', deep-down-body based on Chuck Berry's 'You Can't Catch Me' but complete with lyrics like 'hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease' and 'he shoot coca-cola' which Berry couldn't have thought up in a million years because he was too busy asking drunken whores to poop in his mouth. George's 'Something' is the best (pre-All Things Must Pass) ballad I've ever heard from the guy, as melodic as Paul and as serious and no-bullshit as John. Paul's first salvo (god, I hate that critic word. I hope I never use it.) is the murderous children's song 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer', which is based around the refrain 'Bang bang Maxwell's Silver Hammer came down...upon her head (doop da doo da doo!)' and probably qualifies as one of the weirder songs by that guy. And the most likely to be paranoically banned at a modern high school dance. 'Oh! Darling' is more like it, sounding sorta like 'Something' but much rougher (more like a John song, really...and John wanted to sing it no less, but the megalomaniac Paul wouldn't let him) and...not as good. Ringo's only singing moment here is 'Octopus' Garden', a remake of 'Yellow Submarine' in theme, and yes, by far the worst thing on the album. Not to say it's particularly bad, but geez. Do I need a second children's song about the ocean from the Beatles? Isn't one enough?

John chimes back in with his second happy ballad of the album, the droning and unforgiving 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)', which boasts Dylan-y wordplay and sweet McCartney-esque melodies. No really. When the heaving dark cloud of 'I Want You' finally blows past at 8 minutes or whatever, and the chiming acoustic intro to 'Here Comes The Sun' breaks through, I really feel like it's the first day of spring. What a wonderful effect. Plus, 'Here Comes The Sun' is joyous and bright all the way through. I love that little song. Well done George, you really don't have to be all harsh (think 'Taxman' or 'Blue Jay Way') to make a great tune."
pos,"This is probably my favorite Beatle album but honestly there are probably 6 albums tied for my favorite. 
To me it really feels like The White Album come together. The White Album always sounded like 2 1/2 solo albums put together. Abbey Road feels like it was meant to be a full album, much more focused. If the White Album was the sound of four solo artists, then Abbey Road is four solo artists coming together to form a Super Group. 
Side A works very well together and as individual songs. Powerful when it needs to be, soft when it needs to be. Grungy, melodic, groovy, beautiful, whatever the mood calls for. 
Ideas seem to sway almost erratically throughout the album. Even within You Never Give Me Yr Money, although it's labeled as one song it feels more like three put together, brilliantly. 
One of the best albums that will ever grace yr music player. Perfect right up to the end. Almost...
My one and only gripe on the album. Her Majesty. C'mon Paul why did you have to tack it on there. The End is one of the most amazing things I've ever heard. After a threeway guitar solo where everyone rips it up and a great drum solo followed out by their beautiful 3 part harmonies. It would have been the perfect swan song but no this got tacked on at the end. A wart on an otherwise perfect curtain call."
pos,"Buy this, now. The first use of synthesizers on a rock record that made any musical sense (in contrast, see the Notorious Byrds Brothers), but that's hardly the reason this record burns itself into your soul. It's simply brilliant, from start to finish. If you haven't heard gems like ""Here Comes The Sun,"" ""Something"" (both by Harrison!), Lennon's devastating ""Come Together"" and dreamy, harmonious ""Because,"" and McCartney's infamous ""pop symphony,"" which dominates side 2, you haven't lived."
pos,"""Abbey Road"" uses a ""less is more"" approach to production throughout, giving ""Come Together"" a controlled intensity while the raw sound of Paul's voice on ""Oh! Darling"" is one of the album's highlights. The sound of a whole band working together flawlessly is heard most notably in the 8-track medley that made up the second side of the vinyl; finishing fittingly with ""The End."""
pos,"The final album the Beatles recorded is an epic note to go out on. It's also a pretty good group effort, with all three songwriters contributing classic material.

The intro is John's ""Come Together"" and it isn't bad, Paul gets to lay down a slick bass riff, but I've never liked this song as much as everyone else does, I think because of how slowly the song feels like it crawls along. He also adds the Yoko inspired ""Because"" which uses 9 track harmony, applying an almost celestial quality to it. ""She's So Heavy"" has a great guitar riff and is an interesting way to close the first half, even if it tends to go on a bit long.

George gets two songs and it represents the highest quality of recordings he ever made for one Beatles album. ""Something"" is a smooth love song, one of the Beatles most covered ever, but even better than that is ""Here Comes the Sun"". The Beatles add great harmonies to George and it feels just like the sun is beaming down on your face, it could very well be the best song George ever made, pure bliss. Upon hearing ""Something"" Paul stated that George had finally become as good of a writer as him and John. This is of course not true as George had already reached that point by The White Album, if not by Revolver. Ringo also chips in ""Octopus' Garden"" which is a fun novelty song, and although credits claim it was written by Ringo, George had a heavy hand in writing it, if we include that George had the best output on the album. 

Paul's ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" takes an odd topic and sound. It also shows Paul's strange tendency to take dark subjects and make them silly (see McCartney outtake Suicide). The tune itself isn't bad, but apparently this was the most frustrating song for the other Beatles to work on due to Paul's perfectionist nature, and this song should not have been laboured over like it was the albums crowning jewel. ""Oh Darling!"" is probably my least favourite cut on the album, it's okay but it depends purely on Paul's vocals, and while he gives it his all with a rock'n'roll ragged voice it just doesn't do enough to carry a song for me. Paul easily had the weakest contributions on the album.

If the medley wasn't his baby, which it was. I wish John consented to making the whole album like this, cause it's the best part. ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" is enchanting before mellowing out with ""Sun King"" where the lyrics are literal nonsense. Then we get a couple of snippet rockers, with ""She Came Through the Bathroom Window"" excelling in particular. The mood is brought down once more as Paul serenades us with ""Golden Slumbers"" before everyone inevitably sings along with ""Carry That Weight"", then everyone trades solos on ""The End"" before the classic line. I think it would have been better without ""Her Majesty"" because if anyone deserved to end on such a grandiose note, it was The Beatles. I'd also liked George to have had a snippet to make it a true group effort, but it's still excellent.

Extremely underrated, but it's not difficult to see why. Although all of these songs were written and recorded during 1969, it was only released in 1970 as somewhat of an 'afterthought.' By this time, nobody in the group at all liked anybody else in the group (well, except maybe Ringo - everybody loves Ringo), and the result is that the album sounds much less like a group effort than even Abbey Road, which was recorded later. And in the fact that the songs have an extremely countryish flavor to them and that the production is not done by George Martin, but rather by Phil ""wall-of-sound"" Spector, and the end result is often ignored by even hardcore fans.

This is not an impeccable album (I'm not a big fan of this live version of One After 909, and stuff like Maggie Mae and Dig It, while entertaining, are really dumb) but the good stuff is really good, and that's enough for me. And I didn't even mention the most famous song on the album, the 'rockin' Get Back, an extremely solid upbeat track that served as the third single from this release. In any case, this was certainly a strange way for the Beatles to end their career together (sort of), and many critics panned the album upon its release, but no true Beatles fan will be ashamed of this. Or the grand finale, for that matter"
pos,"My favourite album. The most remarkable thing about this album and what makes it so great is the difference in songs on side, you get a 70's rock sounding song followed by a schmaltzy love song, then a dark humour song, then an older-syle full throated vocals style, then a fun kid-friendly song, followed by a dirty sexual rocking 7 minute long song, then an acoustic bright song, and then finally a dream-esque sounding song. And then we have the medley on side 2 which is truly amazing. In a way, this album sums up the entire beatles career, it covers many styles of music which the Beatles did previously and the ending while many think it should end on Paul McCartney's fantastic words, I absolutely love it because no matter what sentimental message about love they say, at their heart the Beatles were just bunch of jokers. Once again, the superb tracking of this album and the summary and celebration of the entire Beatles music career on their final record make this album my favourite album of all time, I will never get tired of it."
pos,"Although I have heard this album for the ten thousandth time, it is a great album! A momentum in time. Just listen"
pos,"The sound of a star exploding and going out. The best band in the world goes out with a bang not a whimper. Amongst the animosity and the in fighting something so beautiful could be made is quite amazing. But such was the level of talent in this group. Come Together, Here Comes the Sun, Because, Something, what could have been if The Beatles had remained together. But thank God for what we got when they were."
pos,"""Abbey Road"" sees the Beatles continue to operate as some sort of musical collective rather than a properly functioning band, although unlike on ""The White Album"" they are reasonably convincing in their efforts to put over the illusion of a united front. The gambit gets off on the right foot (or so it would seem) with the opening track, titled Come Together - that is, until you realise that its a blatant cop of Chuck Berry's You Can't Catch Me. The rest of the songs on Side One proceed pretty much in the same vein as ""The White Album"" with each track bearing little in common with the one before it; and the song quality varies almost as greatly: for every Something, we wind up with a lame duck like Maxwell's Silver Hammer. Things do not improve on Side Two, where we find the Beatles haven't even bothered to finish off most of the songs and have knitted them together into an (almost) side-long 'suite' instead. Admittedly the conceit is accomplished with some degree of aplomb. But this is a triumph of production over band dynamics. ""Abbey Road"" has long been mistaken for the Beatles' triumphant swansong. In fact, the album is all the evidence needed to confirm that the Beatles, as a band, were a spent creative force."
pos,"With excellent writing, both lyrically and musically, great production, and superb composition, this isn?t just one of the best album by the Beatles, but it?s one of the best albums of all time, period, as the phenomenal material here makes this a masterpiece of rock music that nobody should ever pass by."
neg,"Be wary. An album to be entitled Get Back was recorded months before Abbey Road as an experiment in filming the band ""live in the studio,"" and then allowed to languish when no one could agree on a finished product. A year later, with the film's release date nearing and the title now changed to Let It Be, the already-disbanded Beatles talked producer Phil Spector into cobbling together a ""soundtrack."" Spector, who had never worked with the band before, proceeded to butcher several songs by plastering on a full orchestra and a nauseating female chorus (Paul's formulaic ballads ""The Long And Winding Road"" and the title track, a rehash of ""Hey Jude""; George's mournful, waltzing ""I Me Mine""; John's leftover psychedelic anthem ""Across The Universe""). The unmutilated selections are either trivial toss-offs (their resurrected early 60s rockabilly number ""One After 909""), pleasant but unremarkable pop songs (""Two Of Us""; ""Dig A Pony""; Paul's Aretha Franklin-like ""I've Got A Feeling""; ""For You Blue""), or slightly different versions of songs that you can get on Past Masters Vol. 2 (""Get Back"" and its B-side ""Don't Let Me Down,"" which isn't on the album; title track; ""Across The Universe""). Billy Preston contributes keyboards throughout, but it hardly helps."
neg,"Phil Spector should have been put in prison for this at the time, then Lana Clarkson would be alive today! It took decades but thank God they came out with ""Naked"", so much better it can now be listened to more than once a year or longer! Hard to say, but worst Beatles album, because of the production, not the music! P.S. ""Yellow Submarine"" is great! I even like George Martin's side every once in awhile and don't suffer like listening to ""Let It Be""!"
pos,"Absolutely fantastic. I can't think of a more fitting way to end the legacy of one of, if not the best band of all time.
"
pos,"The Beatles' final studio album is more than a career summation: it is a greeting and a parting, a birth and a funeral. Greetings to George Harrison, emerging from the ""quiet one"" archetype to become a full-fledged equal partner, and farewell to the myth of the Fab Four.

As mentioned, Harrison's two songs here are the most obvious standouts: ""Here Comes the Sun"" is warmth and summer joy embodied, and ""Something"" is one of the most gorgeous love ballads ever written, complete with the languid fluidity of his guitar playing and vocals at their best. But the rest of the album is no slouch: ""Come Together"" and ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" start and end Side 1 with some of the hardest rock the Beatles ever laid down. Paul McCartney's characteristic genre-bending weirdness gets a Moog-assisted showcase in the rock/vaudeville hybrid ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer,"" and the long-standing tradition of Ringo getting a country-inflected song to sing here continues with ""Octopus's Garden,"" a children's song for the ages but a standout for all ages. (Side 2's ""Because"" is haunting, with its washes of harmony and synthesizer, but I'm of the opinion that the stripped down a capella mix from ""Love"" is the superior version.)

After a series of pleasant but slightly undercooked mini-songs in the Side 2 ""medley,"" we reach the deepest and most honestly melancholy thing the Beatles ever recorded, a trio of songs that serve as funeral and wake for the band that changed the world. Paul sings ""Once there was a way to get back home"" on ""Golden Slumbers,"" a lullaby and elegy for the band, just before all four voices chime in in unison, singing ""You're gonna carry that weight a long time."" It's as if they all realized at once that the good old days were suddenly over with the band's dissolution, that no matter what happened in their solo work, it would all be downhill from here.

But it's not over: the band opts to end on a high note with ""The End,"" their final blessing to the fans. As they sing ""Love you, love you"" to their listeners and each other, they remind us of the band's essential message: that it isn't the drama, the ambition or the hurt feelings that matter in the end, but merely the love we take, and make. (If we're being fair, the album ends officially with ""Her Majesty,"" a Paul skiffle ditty intended for elsewhere in the medley; similarly, the semi-legal Purple Panda edit of the album continues with several late-period Beatles singles and then ""live in the studio"" recordings.)

Hail and farewell, Beatles. At the time I write this, two of you are dead and two of you are alive, but none of you will ever truly be gone."
pos,"It is a testament to the Beatles' continuing musical growth that their final album is also arguably their best. The band took a far earthier musical approach to this record than they had with Sgt. Pepper's, Magical Mystery Tour, or the so-called ""White Album,"" probably a reflection of the back-to-roots influence that the Band was having on popular music at the time. Even so, it is no less progressive in its songwriting, variety, and production. McCartney and Lennon provided some classics as they always had, but this time George Harrison's contributions eclipse anything from his bandmates. ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun,"" both by Harrison are as good as, arguably better than, anything else on the record, and certainly can hold their own against the best songs that the team of Lennon and McCartney ever produced. This record is a masterpiece of pop songcraft and production, a landmark for reasons beyond its iconic cover."
pos,"Greatest Beatles recording, for a number of reasons. George's two songs, the best ones he's ever written. The Side 2 opus, led by Paul. The trading off of guitar solos on The End (Paul-George-John, then repeat). Ringo's only recorded drum solo, and his finest songwriting contribution. The beautiful three-part vocals on Because.

A band that came of age as two of the members were about to hit the ripe old age of 30 (the other two were younger!). Leave 'em wanting more? The Beatles did just that with this, their final recording."
pos,The last Beatles masterpiece had a timeless sound in first place
pos,"This, their swansong, was as great as anything they had ever done - which is to say as great as anything ever done by anyone in popular music. The medley on side two is justifiably considered by many to be their finest moment as a band, but the whole thing is just a knockout. The way they go out on ""The End"", guitars blazing, is just perfect, and Paul's gentle lyrics couldn't have summed it all up any better."

The 'sequel' to Sgt. Pepper, this was actually somewhat panned by critics upon its release. Most likely, this is due to the fact that the 'style' of the two albums is extremely similar - both rely heavily on orchestration and sound effects with little emphasis on 'traditional' rock instrumentation (of course, it might also have to do with the fact that the TV special to which the first side of this album is the soundtrack is apparently very, very wierd). Well, critics are dumb. Actually, I honestly don't know if this is stronger or weaker than Sgt. Bilko, and as such I can't really say if this is a 5 stars or a 4 1/2 (I settle on the later, but it's a really arbitrary call). But really, who cares?

Once again, I really don't know how to conclude the review other than to say something to the effect of, ""if you don't own this, BUY IT NOW,"" so I guess that will have to suffice. Seriously, though, it is truly a testament to the band's greatness that they were able to come up with two virtually perfect albums IN THE SAME YEAR and still have enough gas left for more masterpieces ... of course, you might not like it. If that's the case ... well, poop on you then."
neg,"Will, Megaman, Nightmares? of the Bottom and the chilling President Carter.
These beats are really nice and I can listen in pleasure. Nothing Kanye West or The Neptune's level but still excellent nonetheless. Where this album falls apart is the lyrical aspect. Other than President Carter and maybe 2 or 3 other verses here and there this is a criminal perpetration both against the lyrical aspect of hip-hop and the English language itself.
Punch-line after punch-line after punch-line after more and more punch-lines. This would be slightly forgivable if 2 things were to occur.
A. The jokes were actually funny.
B.They said anything even close to substantial in regards to society, politics, or even anything other than gangster culture and braggadocio.
IN FACT, as sad as this may be, the best songs on the album lyrically DON'T EVEN FEATURE LITTLE WAYNE But they feature verses from greats like Nas, Andre 3000, Tech N9ne, and a great verse from Cory Gunz. Not only is that sad but when Nas mentions great lyricists ON LIL WAYNE'S ALBUM he doesn't even mention Lil Wayne but mentions Kanye West and Eminem as ""lyrical tyrants"".
Wayne's flow is very boring and his voice is incredibly annoying at times. Experimenting with autotune ended when Kanye West did 808's and heartbreak and made autotune amazing (though literally nobody else repeated the success) and then killing it. Lil Wayne obviously didn't get the memo.
This album has so many abysmal jokes and punchlines it's like a Yakof Smirnoff comedy show with some good musical interludes in-between breaks(The production on some songs).
Here are some brilliant quips from both the self proclaimed AND consumer proclaimed ""greatest rapper alive"".
"
neg,"Lil Wayne gets away with too much. His latest work has been absolutely horrendous and his fans gobble it up, the critics go easy on him, and his team of yes men gives him the okay on nearly any travesty you could imagine.

This album has close to zero replay value. The only tracks I have revisited have been She Will and Mirror because Drake and Bruno kill the hooks, and the Outro because of the guests. Nas is the highlight of the album, bringing the best verse on a track where Wayne is nowhere to be found.

Throughout, Wayne has TERRIBLE lines galore. Some that make you facepalm, some that make zero sense, and an abundance of lines that make you shake your head. Wayne's flow is stale and repetetive, and he never truly goes in on a verse. In fact, nearly every verse is ruined by one of his many ADHD punchlines. They rendered me unable to take Wayne seriously, and made me wonder how Wayne could have seriously thought people could like them.

The only redeeming factors are the Interlude, Outro and a few of the beats, and Wayne didn't take part in any of these either.

This album gets one point for the beats, and one for the guest verses. Wayne himself gets a 0 for effort.

Sadly, millions are inevitably going into the pocket of one of the laziest and most useless men on the planet."
neg,"Let Me start by saying this, The album had potential. Some of these beats are phenomenal like ""John"" (A.K.A. The song he stole from Rick Ross, look up ""I'm not a Star"" By Rick Ross, it sounds exactly the same), and ""She Will"". The guests are great as well as Drake, Rick Ross, Nas, and Tech N9ne lay down some sick rhymes in this album. Overall its just a fantastic album... BUT This little guy who goes by the rapper name ""Lol Wayne""... *Ahem* excuse Me ""LIL Wayne"" decides its a good idea to take a giant dump on all of these songs and then release it under his name. In all seriousness, Lil Wayne has the most annoying, disgusting, nasty voice in all of music. This is a pathetic excuse for rap, Why does he have such a big fan base? His voice is vomit inducing. You have to be deaf to like the piece of bull crap"
neg,"I've never been a huge fan of Lil Wayne but some of his past projects have been solid. But its sad when the best thing about your album is a Nas verse. Or that the second best thing is the 3stacks verse, or that the five best verses on your album don't include any of your own. Especially when some dude (Shyne) who sounds like an elderly man without dentures who's been smoking all his life, at the age of 31 sounds better than you. And you can accept lines like ""Faded, f-ckin faded, aww yeah im f-ckin faded"" from someone on your label, and still be barely over par from them.

Lil Wayne has had a fairly okay run, music wise and has a good fan base and lots of recognition and respect. He should hang it up before he ruins all of that"
neg,"Doesn't need to be a hip hop stan or lil wayne haters to know that this album is the lowest common denominator in hip hop: corny punchlines, far from cohesive beat selections/empty-head-banger & corny punchlines.

I'll give 1 point just because Tech N9ne, Bun B and Nas are featured in this album."

neg,"This is an abridged, track by track review of Lil' Wayne's 'Tha Carter IV'. Intro - This track contains an expected amount of barely innuendo rhymes. It has simple, straightforward lyrics. The beat has a production value of 5 out of 10, anyone with a Mac can pull it off.

Blunt Blowin - Another easy to follow track, but still is a generally pointless rap song, almost out of character for Wayne. Also the same is the low production quality of the track itself; simple bass lines, nothing special to mention.

Megaman - Once again, another simply produced track, and lyrics to be expected from Lil' Wayne. He strays away from the higher pitched voice he normally uses, and that isn't necessarily terrible.

6 Foot 7 Foot feat. Cory Guns - Very little clever wordplay, absolutely terrible production. The featuring of Day-O by Harry Belafonte was bizarre, but the thought was killed by how absolutely unbearably annoying the repetitiveness of the song is. Cory Guns' verse almost revives the song, but it is almost too far beyond repair to fix.

Nightmares of the Bottom - A song intended to be a slow jam, starting off with the signature lighter flick, vaguely reminiscent of the verses of Mrs. Officer. Still a mediocre track.

She Will feat. Drake - A song about a girl, not too catchy, really just another song about how he wants to f**k. Drake conforms to this mentality.

How To Hate feat. T-Pain - This track was actually one of my favorites on the album. In simplest terms, its a F**k You song to a girl. The track feels like its T-Pain's instead of Wayne's and features his brilliant use of autotune. In fact, Lil' Wayne's parts in the song sort of ruin it for me.

Interlude feat Tech N9ne and Andre 3000 - Possibly the best track on the album, and that may be just because Tech has the Midas Touch. Andre on the other hand is a refreshing addition, and its nice to see that he still has talent.

John feat Rick Ross - A song with a violent dirty south beat leaves no more than that to be desired.

Abortion - I couldn't get past the first 20 seconds, it was that annoying.

So Special feat John Legend - The only good parts are the ones that involve John Legend.

How to Love - One of only two entirely bearable tracks on the cd, and I feel the only reason for that is because it has more of an R&B feel, and can be played on the radio. Through and through, easy to listen to on repeat.

President Carter - *Lighter flick* The production quality is better than the lyrics, seems like it may have been an idea when someone was searching for lost Doritos. Hint, hint.

Its Good feat Jadakiss and Drake - Beat was good, catchy, Jadakiss shines.

Outro feat Bun B, Nas, Shyne, Busta Rhymes - Nas and Busta killed this track, amazing flow. Very glad that Wayne kept out of it.

Out of the three bonus tracks, I decided to add in Mirror featuring Bruno Mars. This track should have been on the cd as a regular track, because bonus tracks usually imply they might have been discarded. I actually like this track, the overall feel of it is smooth and easy on the ears.

All in all, the record blows. I feel it has reached the time that Wayne Carter just needs to throw in the towel and produced tracks for guests to come in on. As a rap record, I give this cd a 6 out of 10. As a Lil' Wayne record, it gets a 3"

neg,"chris Brown's debut?particularly his breakthrough ringtone, err, single ""Run It""?found the supposed R&B; wunderkind doing an impersonation of all-grown-up R&B; wunderkind Usher doing an impersonation of the original R&B; wunderkind, Michael Jackson, and if his over-the-top, overrated performance at this year's MTV Video Music Awards is any indication, he isn't taking the glove off anytime soon. Aside from his dance moves, though, Brown doesn't have the voice (the lisp isn't cute, though it's preferable to T-Pain, who sounds a lot like SNL player Keenan Thompson's DJ Dynasty Handbag on the intro to the single ""Kiss Kiss""), and he offers little to nothing that hasn't already been done (or imitated) better. For Brown fans who think I'm harping to much on the MJ comparisons, he also dresses up like D.M.C. in one photo and, with his jeans slung low, he's one fad away from wearing them backwards in another. And forget the so-called King of Pop: Prince is probably the single most aped artist of the last couple of years, and while the beats on ""Take You Down"" and ""You"" sound like Prince on a morphine drip, those songs lack the provocative, industrious quality that made him more than simply a good musician and producer. Production team Stargate regurgitate their ""Irreplaceable"" formula?which is in serious need of replacing?on ""With You,"" meaning that even when things bounce back to the present, there's still nothing very ""exclusive"" about Exclusive at all.
These beats are really nice and I can listen in pleasure. Nothing Kanye West or The Neptune's level but still excellent nonetheless. Where this album falls apart is the lyrical aspect. Other than President Carter and maybe 2 or 3 other verses here and there this is a criminal perpetration both against the lyrical aspect of hip-hop and the English language itself.
Punch-line after punch-line after punch-line after more and more punch-lines. This would be slightly forgivable if 2 things were to occur.
A. The jokes were actually funny.
B.They said anything even close to substantial in regards to society, politics, or even anything other than gangster culture and braggadocio.
IN FACT, as sad as this may be, the best songs on the album lyrically DON'T EVEN FEATURE LITTLE WAYNE But they feature verses from greats like Nas, Andre 3000, Tech N9ne, and a great verse from Cory Gunz. Not only is that sad but when Nas mentions great lyricists ON LIL WAYNE'S ALBUM he doesn't even mention Lil Wayne but mentions Kanye West and Eminem as ""lyrical tyrants"".
Wayne's flow is very boring and his voice is incredibly annoying at times. Experimenting with autotune ended when Kanye West did 808's and heartbreak and made autotune amazing (though literally nobody else repeated the success) and then killing it. Lil Wayne obviously didn't get the memo.
This album has so many abysmal jokes and punchlines it's like a Yakof Smirnoff comedy show with some good musical interludes in-between breaks(The production on some songs).
Here are some brilliant quips from both the self proclaimed AND consumer proclaimed ""greatest rapper alive"".

pos,"Lil Wayne gets away with too much. His latest work has been absolutely horrendous and his fans gobble it up, the critics go easy on him, and his team of yes men gives him the okay on nearly any travesty you could imagine.

This album has close to zero replay value. The only tracks I have revisited have been She Will and Mirror because Drake and Bruno kill the hooks, and the Outro because of the guests. Nas is the highlight of the album, bringing the best verse on a track where Wayne is nowhere to be found.

Throughout, Wayne has TERRIBLE lines galore. Some that make you facepalm, some that make zero sense, and an abundance of lines that make you shake your head. Wayne's flow is stale and repetetive, and he never truly goes in on a verse. In fact, nearly every verse is ruined by one of his many ADHD punchlines. They rendered me unable to take Wayne seriously, and made me wonder how Wayne could have seriously thought people could like them.

The only redeeming factors are the Interlude, Outro and a few of the beats, and Wayne didn't take part in any of these either.

This album gets one point for the beats, and one for the guest verses. Wayne himself gets a 0 for effort.

Sadly, millions are inevitably going into the pocket of one of the laziest and most useless men on the planet."
neg,"Let Me start by saying this, The album had potential. Some of these beats are phenomenal like ""John"" (A.K.A. The song he stole from Rick Ross, look up ""I'm not a Star"" By Rick Ross, it sounds exactly the same), and ""She Will"". The guests are great as well as Drake, Rick Ross, Nas, and Tech N9ne lay down some sick rhymes in this album. Overall its just a fantastic album... BUT This little guy who goes by the rapper name ""Lol Wayne""... *Ahem* excuse Me ""LIL Wayne"" decides its a good idea to take a giant dump on all of these songs and then release it under his name. In all seriousness, Lil Wayne has the most annoying, disgusting, nasty voice in all of music. This is a pathetic excuse for rap, Why does he have such a big fan base? His voice is vomit inducing. You have to be deaf to like the piece of bull crap"
neg,"I've never been a huge fan of Lil Wayne but some of his past projects have been solid. But its sad when the best thing about your album is a Nas verse. Or that the second best thing is the 3stacks verse, or that the five best verses on your album don't include any of your own. Especially when some dude (Shyne) who sounds like an elderly man without dentures who's been smoking all his life, at the age of 31 sounds better than you. And you can accept lines like ""Faded, f-ckin faded, aww yeah im f-ckin faded"" from someone on your label, and still be barely over par from them.

Lil Wayne has had a fairly okay run, music wise and has a good fan base and lots of recognition and respect. He should hang it up before he ruins all of that"

neg,"Well, what can I say about an artist whom everyone has talked about? Everyone has an opinion on him, so what makes mine different from everyone elses? Well I can say this, there was a gap (from 2004 to 2008 maybe 2009) when I could safely say I liked Lil Wayne. Tha Carter I & II were terrific albums. No they weren't classics, but they were very impressive, his mixtapes were great too and Lil Wayne was in his prime. I was probably one of the few people who defended Tha Carter III, not because I loved it, but because I thought there were enough good songs to outweigh the bad. Then Rebirth dropped and my opinion of him dropped as well. So yeah I wasn't really excited for this project. But hey, you know what Wayne was out of prison, he sobered up from cough syrup and I even liked 6'7' a lot. I got a little bit excited when I saw Tech N9ne, Andre 3000 and Nas were on the album. So of course I listened. And, big shock, I didn't like it. The production sounds bland compared to his other albums, he sounds tired as hell and every feature (except Shyne and T-Pain of course) sounds better than Lil Wayne here. It's sad when people say the two highlights of your album are the songs YOU are not on. Not only that, but Wayne's lyrics are as goofy as ever. With lines like ""Hear no evil, see no evil, #HellenKeller"" or ""We're in the belly of the beast and she wants an abortion"" or ""All about my riches, My name should be Richard"" or ""All I had to do was put two and two together/ But that just makes four, but not 'four-ever'"" or especially ""Don't fuck
 up with Wayne/ 'Cause when it Waynes it pours."" I don't remember Tha Carter III fucking up this badly. The worst thing is Weezy's singing on songs like How To Love and Abortion. By the way, when I saw the title Abortion, I thought to myself ""Wow Lil Wayne is actually going into details about the tough time going through an abortion, for both the male and female. Shedding a new light on the subject"". I perhaps gave him too much credit. So yeah this album sucks, what did you expect? Wayne will probably continue down this path until it stops making him money and he'll find something new to do. Whoopty doo"

neg,"This latest in ?Tha Carter? series enters the realm of being unquantifiably cack, to the point where it could go full circle and become a work of genius, but falls short at the last Auto-Tuned hurdle. With ?Tha Carter III? there was a touch of idiot savant about Mr Wayne. He looked and carried himself like a sizzurp-addled goblin but turned out a bass-laden album, packed with shamelessly crowd-pleasing hits like ?Lollipop? and ?A Milli?. In comparison, the upbeat singles here ? ?6 Foot 7 Foot? and ?John? ? smack of painting-by-numbers, while fillers like ?Megaman? descend to the quality of bedroom-made FruityLoops demos that would autoplay on your cousin?s Myspace page circa 2005. I could be unkind and compare it to a backstreet abortion, but he?s done that all by himself with the gem of a line, ?I?m a diamond in the rough/Like a baby in the trash?. The only standout track is the downbeat ?President Carter?, though even a dubious pronunciation of ?tiramisu? (yes, really) can?t stop it from sagging halfway.
In short ?Tha Carter IV? flops not because it?s straight-up bad, but because it?s boring. Weezy was once seemingly oblivious to the rest of the rap community. After releasing a string of hip-pop bangers he didn?t have time to argue his credibility, because he was out knobbing models and being incredibly rich. But with the spike of exciting rap we?ve had in the last year, it sounds as though Lil Wayne and his Young Money minions are frantically attempting to recreate past glories. Love him or hate him, it would be a waste if, as rumoured, this is the album he bows out with.

pos,"Let It Be' hit the shelves the following Spring, but the World and its mother knew and knows that 'Abbey Road' is the Beatles' true sendoff. Ironically for an album that one might presume is a farewell ode to the iconic Lennon/McCartney partnership, it's Harrison who provides THE two sparkling moments with 'Here Comes The Sun' and 'Something', signifying a creative hot streak that would become truly apparent on 'All Things Must Pass'. 'Come Together' is of particular note as being the only Beatles number that John played at his final full length concerts at MSG in 1972, while McCartney's closing medley serves as a fitting finale, containing just a little bit of everything that made him arguably the pre-eminent pop songwriter of the '60s and possibly even the '70s. With great respect, I think it's also more appropriate that a Paul suite ended the Beatles' active career rather than something from John, as despite the integral pathos and social gravitas that Lennon bought to every one of their studio masterpieces, ultimately the Fab Four were seen as a 'happy' band overall and so it was only right that a touch of McCartney whimsy sent them off into the (sadly initially bitter and legally troubled) sunset."
neg,"The n-word loving Kreayshawn sidekick and White Girl Mob member V-Nasty teams up with ice cream-loving Gucci Mane to make a collaboration that no one asked for. Although the pairing comes as a surprise, the mixtape boasts unimaginative lines that fall flat. In fact, BAYTL can only be appreciated if looked at for its sheer novelty appeal, thanks to V-Nasty?s laughable attempts at rapping.
At one point she claims she?s ?more hood than David Banner? (Banner took issue with her nonchalant use of the n-word), and from then on it?s obvious that she can?t be taken seriously. On every track her obnoxious and nasally voice overshadows what could have been a win for Gucci, had he dropped the Bay Area brat from his ATL style. As if her act isn?t already unconvincing, so too are her over-the-top wannabe bad bitch rhymes that obsess over ?bitches selling pussy? more than even Gucci himself cares to.
The Ice Cream Man, for the first time, throws some variety into his syrupy slow rhymes, which is enough to make him look like Biggie Smalls reincarnated next to V-Nasty?s lack of talent and originality. Simplistic beats powered by long-time Gucci collaborator Zaytoven suit him well, and he sounds comfortable on each track. He gets extra points for some of the clever (for him) lines he delivers, such as, ?I?m not romantic but I cook my dope candlelit? (?Out My Circle?). Still, it?s not enough to save BAYTL from being just another unnecessary, forgettable mixtape.
Play this once for the WTF-moments (Gucci: ?You know she gobble on my balls like they crunch n? munch?; V-Nasty: ?No need for a preacher. Pray to me. I?ll be your father?), and then be glad the end of the year is almost over, so we can put this all behind us and forget about it."
neg,"it's hard to determine what the biggest surprise is regarding BAYTL: that it wasn't a joke, or that it isn't a joke. As far as the former goes: Yes, this thing exists. Gucci Mane, once one of the most prolific and popular rappers in the South, has done a full album with V-Nasty, the Kreayshawn sidekick who's famous only for being a white person that has vigorously defended her usage of, and her further right to use, the n-word. As for the latter, BAYTL is a surprisingly competent and sometimes fun low-stakes rap album, far from the disaster it could've been.
Though there are many ways in which the album might have gone off the rails, it's fairly easy to pinpoint why it often succeeds. One major reason is that Gucci and V-Nasty smartly decided to let underground big shot Zaytoven-- long one of Gucci's favorite and most fruitful collaborators-- handle the lion's share of the production. His beats are workshops in space and melody, stretching keyboard notes (that mimic organs) like they're taffy until the rappers have a melodic, yet unobtrusive, canvas to paint on. In Gucci's heyday the two were a constant source of gold, with Zay's production pairing harmoniously with Gucci's playful, inventive flows. On BAYTL, Zay is probably asked to carry too much of the load, and his effectiveness becomes dulled over the course of the album. But allowing him to produce nearly the entire record brings professionalism, cohesion, and coherence to a project that threatened to have none of the above.
V-Nasty, for her part, also acquits herself better than you would think. Her voice is atonal in a way that's more off-putting than interesting, and her flow can get clumsy and cluttered at times, but she's more or less up to the task of writing half of a decent album, which is more than you could say for some rappers famous for being actual rappers. She gets by well enough on swagger and brashness, and without the baggage her contributions would scan as acceptingly perfunctory. It would be hard to argue that the world needs V-Nasty's rapping-- and it doesn't, obviously-- but she'll get clowned for being a try-hard white girl when in reality there were at least four worse rappers in XXL's ""2011 Freshman Class."""
neg,"Partying all over rap like Nas never happened, the mush-mouth favorite Gucci Mane and the appropriately titled V-Nasty combine forces on this odd collabo called Baytl, which is as ridiculous, messy, and crass as fans want it to be. Even tasteful outsiders must admit that the ?drugs go in, party anthem comes out? formula is still working here for the hedonist messiah they call Gucci, with ?It?s Gucci Nickelodeon, you just a custodian/I never say never, so I might be cookin? dope again? being a good example of his nutball brilliance. Another example, ?I took the bitch out for breakfast/But I gave her dick for lunch,? along with all the purple syrup talk should let parents know he?s a poor guidance counselor. V-Nasty, the Kreayshawn affiliate known for her abuse of the ?N? word, is an even worse role model, but her whiny boasts and trashy girl power attitude offer an amusing contrast to her thuggish, brutish partner. ?Every time I grab the mike I eat it up, Osama? is how she confusingly rolls, all while declaring that she?ll smoke up all your weed, liberate the cough syrup from your medicine cabinet, and get in a catfight with any chick that looks at her wrong. When Gucci offers her a ?you ain?t my lady? set-up on ?Let?s Get Faded,? she blabs about her crew, a blown opportunity representative of the non-chemistry throughout the album. Marquee value is probably why they were paired, but the Tracy Morgan-meets-Scarface track called ?Food Plug? is one of Gucci?s most deliciously odd moments, and V-Nasty just happens to be there. Zaytoven and Kori Anders provide the able party beats as Chuck D, Madlib, Mr. Lif, Mos Def, the Roots, and many other symbols of hip-hop excellence stay home, leaving it up to Slim Dunkin and Mr. Fab, who both offer their services to this loud and obnoxious ruckus.

I only listened to a few songs off of here and V-Nasty was straight HORRIBLE. Her raps mean absolutely nothing and she has an extremely loud and obnoxious voice. The only thing that was even half good about this album was Zaytoven's production. Gucci wasn't horrible either but V-Nasty was the one that made this album bad. What was Gucci thinking when he made this? For a decent rapper, shouldn't he have known better than to create an album with a white rapper that has meaningless lyrics, an extremely loud and annoying voice and overused the N word? I didn't love Trap House 3 but it was a HUGE step-up from this horrible project. Grade: D+. Highlights: ""Fuck You"" saved by Slim "

pos,"The final album the Beatles recorded is an epic note to go out on. It's also a pretty good group effort, with all three songwriters contributing classic material.

The intro is John's ""Come Together"" and it isn't bad, Paul gets to lay down a slick bass riff, but I've never liked this song as much as everyone else does, I think because of how slowly the song feels like it crawls along. He also adds the Yoko inspired ""Because"" which uses 9 track harmony, applying an almost celestial quality to it. ""She's So Heavy"" has a great guitar riff and is an interesting way to close the first half, even if it tends to go on a bit long.

George gets two songs and it represents the highest quality of recordings he ever made for one Beatles album. ""Something"" is a smooth love song, one of the Beatles most covered ever, but even better than that is ""Here Comes the Sun"". The Beatles add great harmonies to George and it feels just like the sun is beaming down on your face, it could very well be the best song George ever made, pure bliss. Upon hearing ""Something"" Paul stated that George had finally become as good of a writer as him and John. This is of course not true as George had already reached that point by The White Album, if not by Revolver. Ringo also chips in ""Octopus' Garden"" which is a fun novelty song, and although credits claim it was written by Ringo, George had a heavy hand in writing it, if we include that George had the best output on the album. 

Paul's ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" takes an odd topic and sound. It also shows Paul's strange tendency to take dark subjects and make them silly (see McCartney outtake Suicide). The tune itself isn't bad, but apparently this was the most frustrating song for the other Beatles to work on due to Paul's perfectionist nature, and this song should not have been laboured over like it was the albums crowning jewel. ""Oh Darling!"" is probably my least favourite cut on the album, it's okay but it depends purely on Paul's vocals, and while he gives it his all with a rock'n'roll ragged voice it just doesn't do enough to carry a song for me. Paul easily had the weakest contributions on the album.

If the medley wasn't his baby, which it was. I wish John consented to making the whole album like this, cause it's the best part. ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" is enchanting before mellowing out with ""Sun King"" where the lyrics are literal nonsense. Then we get a couple of snippet rockers, with ""She Came Through the Bathroom Window"" excelling in particular. The mood is brought down once more as Paul serenades us with ""Golden Slumbers"" before everyone inevitably sings along with ""Carry That Weight"", then everyone trades solos on ""The End"" before the classic line. I think it would have been better without ""Her Majesty"" because if anyone deserved to end on such a grandiose note, it was The Beatles. I'd also liked George to have had a snippet to make it a true group effort, but it's still excellent.
"
pos,"There are a three great songs on here but I do not rate this album, most of it is dross. ""Here Comes The Sun"" is George Harrison's best contribution to the Beatles (""Something"" probably comes in second), and ""Come Together"" is a classic too. Other than that ""I Want You (She's So Heavy) is about as Prog Rock as the Beatles ever get, ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" also has some interesting production (I think you can hear the influence of Frank Zappa on this album) but I don't want to listen to any of the rest of it ever again. Again they indulge Ringo on ""Octopus' Garden"", and the medley is a waste of precious vinyl."

pos,"Considering the quality of the original material on With the Beatles, it shouldn't have been a surprise that Lennon & McCartney decided to devote their third album to all-original material. Nevertheless, that decision still impresses, not only because the album is so strong, but because it was written and recorded at a time when the Beatles were constantly touring, giving regular BBC concerts, appearing on television and releasing non-LP singles and EPs, as well as filming their first motion picture. In that context, the achievement of A Hard Day's Night is all the more astounding. Not only was the record the de facto soundtrack for their movie, not only was it filled with nothing but Lennon-McCartney originals, but it found the Beatles truly coming into their own as a band by performing a uniformly excellent set of songs. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies. They had certainly found their musical voice before, but A Hard Day's Night is where it became mythical. In just a few years, they made more adventurous and accomplished albums, but this is the sound of Beatlemania in all of its giddy glory -- for better and for worse, this is the definitive Beatles album, the one every group throughout the ages has used as a blueprint. Listening to the album, it's easy to see why. Decades after its original release, A Hard Day's Night's punchy blend of propulsive rhythms, jangly guitars, and infectious, singalong melodies is remarkably fresh. There's something intrinsically exciting in the sound of the album itself, something to keep the record vital years after it was recorded. Even more impressive are the songs themselves. Not only are the melodies forceful and memorable, but Lennon and McCartney have found a number of variations to their basic Merseybeat style, from the brash ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Any Time at All,"" through the gentle ""If I Fell,"" to the tough folk-rock of ""I'll Cry Instead."" It's possible to hear both songwriters develop their own distinctive voices on the album, but overall, A Hard Day's Nightstands as a testament to their collaborative powers -- never again did they write together so well or so easily, choosing to pursue their own routes. John and Paul must have known how strong the material is -- they threw the pleasant trifle ""I'm Happy Just to Dance with You"" to George and didn't give anything to Ringo to sing. That may have been a little selfish, but it hardly hurts the album, since everything on the record is performed with genuine glee and excitement. It's the pinnacle of their early years."
pos,"Marx would be proud. Lenin would kick himself, such is the distance by which he missed the ball. Paul McCartney screams the chorus of #1 single Can't Buy Me Love, which lies precisely in the middle of the barely thirty minutes album, with the intent of a true revolutionary. ""I don't care too much for money 'cause money can't buy me love."" OK, it's not exactly the Marxist ideal, but it beats the gulags. The minor-key R&B shuffle backs what is an oddly aggressive vocal, and signals a precedent set throughout the album. The song is typical of the model used on the album: it's short (each song clocks in well below three minutes; it contrasts a bright, abrasive vocal with a melancholic accompaniment; and it utilises a songwriting trick the Beatles made their own, at George Martin's prodding, beginning quickly with the chorus line.

The title track exudes a similar ethos. A Hard Day's Night opens with an infamous, and contentious, augmented G chord (again, probably down to Martin's influence) before launching spiritedly into the chorus: ""It's been a hard day's night/And I've been working like a dog/but when I get home to you/I find the things that you do/Will make me feel all right."" The working man's anthem is one of the oldest songwriting tricks, beaten to death by John Bon Jovi, but that fact in itself is not enough to explain the song's lasting success. The simplistic structure and lyrics are offset by a breath-taking shared vocal and a haunting bridge. Interestingly, Q magazine awarded it the honour of third most exciting song of all-time.

That same immediate chorus formula is observed on no less than six of the thirteen songs on offer. I Should Have Known Better, Tell Me Why and Any Time At All are all short, peppy,perfect pop songs. All utilise the favoured layered vocal style of Lennon and McCartney, which adds some extra punch to the choruses -- not that they need it. The superb vocal styles of all Beatles are often overlooked in favour of their songwriting and instrumental skills, and perhaps A Hard Day's Nightis the best example of those skills. The tracks are generally understated instrument-wise, which ensures the focus is squarely on vocals. George's sole vocal track, I'm Happy Just To Dance With You , is very much a song of its time, an unfortunate casualty of the lack of good recording technology in the '60s, but the vaguely eastern melody wonderfully contrasts the ""pop"" melody. 

George Martin's influence is clearly evident again in the pair of ballads, which also constitute two of the album's highlights. If I Fell features a haunting, classically-influenced melody, sung beautifully in harmony by McCartney(high) and Lennon(lead, bass). It's my favourite track on the album, as it encapsulated everything I love about the early Beatles And I Love Her is driven by a strong, tender vocal by McCartney, Ring's brilliant echoed bongos and some beautiful Spanish guitar picking from George. Despite his sacrilegious use of a pick on nylon-strings, he performs excellently. Also notable is the key-shift to coincide with the guitar solo, avoiding the cliched ""raised final chorus"". 

The final tracks mark an unfortunate dip in quality, but not so severe that they'd be labeled bad or even average tracks. I'll Cry Instead continues Lennon's crying fixation on the album (among other references, If I Fell makes allusions to the same). Evidently, the self-loathing so apparent on the follow-up had yet to take hold. Things We Said Today is the most notable of the remaining tracks, if only for McCartney's beautiful vocal.

If ever I there were the need to dispel the notion of the early Beatles as simply a cheesy pop band, there's no better example of the complicity and depth in that period than the 1964 classic A Hard Day's Night. It's brash, abrasive, even confrontational. It's less ""I want to hold your hand"" and more ""what would you like for breakfast"""" It's the album which should have seen the Beatles hit their stride. The material written for the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which famously starred the four Beatles, was deemed so strong that a separate album release would have to be arranged to accommodate those songs which couldn't appear in the film. Unfortunately, it would take a further two tired albums before they really hit the golden trail with Rubber Soul, Revolverand Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band released sequentially within three years. As it stands, A Hard Day's Night remains a diamond in a sea of emeralds, the one release of the startlingly prolific first three years that remains consistently of top quality throughout.

pos,"This is the sound of Beatlemania, a 13 song set that marks the flowering of a worldbeating songwriting partnership and the studio-ready confidence of their band. From the ripe opening chord (G 11th suspended 4 on guitar and piano) of the title track, the wittily titled 'A Hard Day?s Night? is electric and utterly sure footed. Lennon and McCartney swap lead vocals, the rhythm section just bowls along and Harrison?s solo (doubled on piano) is a work of compact genius. This album is jammed with songs so familiar that just saying their titles can result in spontaneous outbreaks of singing (all together now, 'I Should Have Known Better? ?) and they are stuffed with middle eights that lesser songwriters would have built whole songs around. The playing is a bit more measured, unhurried and exact than before, The Beatles starting to really groove.
Having dispensed with cover versions, Lennon and McCartney?s own writing supplies a depth and variety that more than compensates for the absence of Brill building classics, from the close harmony balladry of 'And I Love Her? and 'If I Fell? to the brooding romanticism of 'Things We Said Today?, the happy swing of McCartney?s 'Can?t Buy Me Love? and punchy, stop-start phrasing of Lennon?s bullying 'You Can?t Do That?. It?s a breathlessly thrilling album.

neg,"Under the teen-pop beats and R&B-trained harmonies, Bon Jovi-style bombast has often lurked beneath the Backstreet Boys? surface. Now that boy-band dance grooves have vanished from radio airwaves, the urge to rock out in a superslick power ballad kinda way dominates Never Gone, the first album in five years from Kevin Richardson, Brian Littrell, Howie Dorough, A.J. McLean and Nick Carter. Never Gone never attains the dizzy heights of previous hits and never reaches far enough toward new territory: The lead single, ?Incomplete,? borrows enough from Coldplay?s piano atmospherics to be both halfway decent and disturbingly crass, and Five for Fighting?s John Ondrasik contributes ?Weird World,? which suggests Ben Folds without the wit. Whether working with their original Swedish Svengali, Max Martin, or platinum producers like John Shanks (Michelle Branch, Kelly Clarkson), the Backstreet men rarely accelerate beyond a midtempo thud. And with all the millions they?ve made, can?t the Backstreet organization afford someone to write better titles than ?My Beautiful Woman? and ?Poster Girl??"
pos,"From the sound of the famous opening chord of the brilliant title track, ""A Hard Day's Night"" breaks through with an astonishingly fresh array of original song material, and being the soundtrack to the influential and innovative movie of the same name. 

Although this review will only talk about the album, not the film. Sorry. All I can say is go watch it if you haven't already. 

Yes yes yes...Lennon-McCartney have officially become great songwriters with the release of ""A Hard Day's Night'. There are no covers to be found here. It's just The Beatles playing and singing to their own messages and feelings through and through. 

I feel there's a little less emphasis on softer ballads and more on the bouncy, hooky rock and roll numbers. This is a very welcome change to be heard because it shows signs of the band not letting up whatsoever. 

The now famous vocal harmonies of the members shines so brightly and the use of louder cymbals and cowbell add an extra spice to The Beatles sound. As mentioned before, the song hooks are back but boy oh boy they have never sounded so catchy before! ""Can't Buy Me Love"" may very well be the prime example with it's sing-along chorus AND verses. The title track is also very sing-songy and is perfect to perform a duet with someone. It also doesn't hurt that the song contains one hard-as-hell guitar solo from Mr. Harrison. Finally, one other that shines with its sing-song approach and hooks is ""You Can't Do That"" with Paul and George's harmonies sounding oh so joyful and Ringo's drums propelling the song with the classic sounds of a cowbell. 

As you can see, there's so much stuff to say about the song arrangements and innovative history that ""A Hard Day's Night"" brings to the Rock and Roll table. If you're a Beatles fan/music lover, this album is an absolute must to own in your collection. It is the best example of The Beatles early Teen Pop days, let alone Beatlemania."

The blandness of the R&B pop-soul arrangements simply throws attention on to the repetitive narrowness of Bieber's delivery. Equally poor are the desultory guest raps by such as Ludacris and Big Sean. The best track by far is ""Take You"", which modulates between two-step shuffle, striding electro and floaty segues, and affords Bieber the opportunity for his most interesting harmony parts."

Besides the fact that he didn't write most of this material if that, he may have wrote none but i'm not sure. The melodies and chords are all very simple but is expected in pop nowadays, this isn't necessarily a bad thing it makes for an easy, light listen but when the lyrics are this bland and all the songs don't differ it won't hold your full attention for the whole album. This is just the record companies way of keeping all his younger fans while also trying to reach older girls, which i won't condemn them for but it just shows that this album is not for me or any guy or any girl over the age of 19 should i say. I'm not saying listening to it is annoying or torture but besides the fact that it's not awful i can't find a reason to give this a positive review"
neg,"Ok, I'm 17 years old and I've nothing against teenager making music, but this is almost unlistenable! There's too much autotune and he doesn't even use his falsetto well. There are a lot of boys and girls of his age that make better music, but they're less famous: go listening to Hayley Westenra's old CDs and you'll know what I mean"
neg,"This album is...I don't know what i could say, because with 10 songs less it could be an awesome ep, by the way, its a completely piece of garbage for say something , because it's not the auto tune the only problem, is the meaningless lyrics and superficial beats and rithms that make this album one of the worst of the entire year, good luck for the next biebs."
pos,"A Hard Day's Night is a silly, fluffy, and disposable movie. Don't get me wrong; it's fun, but I doubt we'd still remember it today if it didn't happen to star one of the most popular and innovative musical acts of the 20th century.

The soundtrack tie-in, on the other hand...

The success of the original songs on the first two covers-heavy Beatles LP's convinced John Lennon and Paul McCartney to pen an entire set of new songs for the third outing. The band is a few years away from transcending their initial influences or acquiring new ones, but an album of all-original material was still a bold step in their growth as artists.

Most of the strengths of the Fab Four's nascent efforts are explored and strengthened here. ""If I Fell"" has a gorgeous arrangement of the harmony singing that The Beatles gleaned off 1960's R&B girl groups. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" emulates the rollicking tone of Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley so wonderfully that one could be forgiven for thinking that it's a cover of an old rockabilly single. ""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You"" charts George Harrison's growing confidence as a songwriter. ""And I Love Her"" boasts one of the prettiest melodies that Paul McCartney ever penned. Of course, there's also the goofy lyrics and thrusting energy of the title cut.

A Hard Day's Night possesses an embarrassment of riches that builds off the foundation of Little Richard, Chuck Berry, the catalog of Motown, and The Beatles' prior accomplishments. No overview of modern pop music would be complete without a hard look at this band and no overview of The Beatles would be complete without a hard look at A Hard Day's Night."
pos,"With this epochal release, the Beatles establish themselves as a rock band like no other before, or no other since.

Bear in mind here, the group was undertaking a punishing schedule throughout the first half of 1964. A world tour, a whirlwind first stop in the United States, filming a movie, and trips in and out of the studio in-between it all; if there was ever a time to release an album of cover tunes, outtakes, or otherwise inferior material to simply promote the movie, the Beatles had the perfect excuse to do so, and nobody would've blame them. Instead, they turn in rock's very first fully self-contained album. John Lennon and Paul McCartney author all the tracks here, the first and last time they were to do so. And these weren't just knocked off tracks either; every song here is a classic, showing a rapidly developing penchant for songwriting that was leaving every other seasoned professional songwriter, even the Brill Building, in the dust. And the instruments and vocals were all Beatles, except for the occasional piano from producer George Martin. Nowhere will you find the true spirit of the peak of Beatlemania than here, this very album. 

The title track grabs your attention from the very first chord, George's Fadd9 played on the Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string guitar, and from there the entire album doesn't let up. The songs thematically aren't derivative of anything they've done before, but they're written and executed as the sum of all their influences: early rock `n roll, soul, R&B, girl groups, Motown, and pop standards, blended together brilliantly, often within the same song.

It should also be noted that this is the first Beatles album recorded on a then-state-of-the-art four track machine, allowing for better mixing, re-doing different instrumental or vocal performances, and for the first time, overdubbing. From here, Beatle product from the studio would grow increasingly sophisticated as they develop. But this album would become their first truly influential release, as people like Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan and Roger McGuinn were taking extensive notes on their music by this time."
pos,"One of the greatest rock albums of the 60's (and all time) and one of the first Beatles records I truly fell in love with. A Hard Day's Night is the sound of the first British invasion in all it's wild and exciting fun. This is kind of record that you would play on Friday or Saturday night out and dance your ass of too it (much like Little Richard's Here's Little Richard, who clearly influenced John Lennon's powerful vocal style in those famed early Beatles recordings). The record is admittedly top loaded (all the best songs, which just happen to form the soundtrack to the movie, make up the entire first side) but it spaces warm, romantic ballads in between faster dance numbers. It starts off nicely with the epic Friday night anthem that is the title track which gets the party going and the feeling continues with I Should Have Known Better before cooling down for a moment with the wistful romantic ballad If I Fell and the sensual, Spanish flavored And I Love Her which are only interrupted by the brief dance interlude I'm Happy Just to Dance With You before picking up pace with immensely fun and catchy Tell Me Why (arguably The Beatles most underrated album track) before hitting a major peak with the show shopping dance song Can't Buy Me Love, one of my favorite Beatles songs. Side two keeps up much of the same energy on tracks like Anytime at All, I'll Cry Instead and You Can't do That, it also contributes completely different feeling that's a bit more moody in nature. If side one captured the peak of Beatlemania, then side two not only does this but subtly shows the direction(s) The Beatles were heading in with their next records. Things We Said Today forms the heart of this second side and it's arguably the most haunting song The Beatles ever recorded as it brings to mind the haunting style of Roy Orbison while When I Get Home is rather angry in nature and I'll Be Back is rather poignant in nature. I personally recommend this for Beatles neophytes as being their first Beatles record to check out."
pos,"Certainly the most experimental Beatles album to this point in their history, Revolver is also arguably one of the riskiest of their entire catalog. The hints of psychedelia and the more mature lyrical subject matter found on Rubber Soul became much more overt on Revolver. Considering that just two years earlier, these guys were recording simpler stuff like ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" only two years older, it is astounding how far their music had matured. Even more impressive, as that all of this exploration happened without Lennon and McCartney losing their sense for great pop music. ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""I'm Only Sleeping,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" and ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" are all terrific to listen to. It's easy to see how this album inspired musicians everywhere to take new leaps with their own music, or just to start bands of their own. It's a monumental album not only in the Beatles catalog, but in the history of popular Western music."
pos,"LSD, experimentation, sitar - and all this to a background of the best Beatles' charm...

Best song: TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS

If Rubber Soul only treaded water in the matters of turning pop-rock into art-rock, then Revolver is the first major art-rock piece by the Fab Four - not conceptual yet, because it lacks an obvious linking theme (if you don't count the amount of acid-induced product, of course), but the first utterly 'serious' album in rock. John has begun his experiments with LSD, and they resulted in the first openly psychedelic songs. The groovy thanatological 'She Said She Said' has never fascinated me, to tell the truth, because I've always felt it was somewhat overproduced; yet it was a milestone in the history of rock lyrics, as the first masked description of an acid trip and its, er, 'side effects'. But the apocalyptic 'Tomorrow Never Knows' was an even bigger milestone - basically, it's a rather simple, drooling melody that one'd expect from bands like the Velvet Underground (for a really, I mean really boring version check out Anthology II), but it's stuffed up with quite a lot of funny little noises obviously reflecting the state of mind in a... oh. You know where. First of all, John lets his voice pass through some gadget so that it manages to sound otherworldly; next, they record a 'wall-of-sound' background track with probably all the instruments they managed to get in the studio, and finally they spice it all up with backwards tapes and such-like stuff to make the most terrific, most representative musical image of a journey through your subconscious ever created by mankind. No kidding.


Even the album cover now is fully schizophrenic: four rough sketches of the Beatles' faces (almost unrecognizable, as a matter of fact) interspersed with lots of smaller photos of the Beatles and other persons; indeed, the cover to Revolver is the first step towards the cover to Sergeant Pepper. And, as usual, no filler. Why is it 'Revolver', I wonder? Did they mean it would produce the same effect?"
pos,"""Revolver"" is The Beatles at their peak of creativity. Surprising shifts in mood prevail on this album--ranging from the bright positivity of ""Good Day Sunshine"" to the paranoia of ""She Said She Said."" The balance of pure harmony {""Here There and Everywhere""} with jangling electric guitar {""And Your Bird Can Sing""], orchestral character portraits {""Eleanor Rigby""} and brassy soul {Got to Get You Into My Life""} is seamless. ""Revolver"" is also one of the first psychedelic albums--with backwards guitar, sitar, sound affects, and complex lyrics throughout--culminating in the mystical finale of ""Tomorrow Never Knows."" Filled with revolutionary studio advances and perfect song craft, the end result is a towering artistic achievement."
pos,"If Rubber Soul was the pot album, Revolver was the acid album. In the months following Rubber Soul, the Beatles expand even further, making music so diverse, so concrete, so unique, so unlike anything anybody else was doing. It's on Revolver they sound so locked in to what they were producing, an immersive effort. Each member of the band giving 110% to the project and adding to as well as creating new musical identities. John's experiences with substances as well as his literary discoveries lead him into unexplored territory, Paul's amazing character studies lead him to see life from all sides, George grows his Indian music fascination deeper as well as looks below the surface at the problems of life, and Ringo provides arguably the best drumming of his Beatles career, and sings with style on Yellow Submarine. So many styles, so many trips, so many experiences, and it's all here. Revolver. Key tracks are Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, Here There And Everywhere, Yellow Submarine, She Said She Said, For No One, Got To Get You Into My Life, and Tomorrow Never Knows."
pos,This was the first album i bought (on casette 1993) and i become a psychadelia fanatic after hear it...i love The Beatles hits since i was a child but this was mind-blowing...this album makes me a rock albums collector...masterpiece!
pos,The Beatles have grown up. Their first venture into psychedelia is one of their most enduring albums for the production value alone; George Martin is as important here as anyone. The Beatles are clearly influenced by the two Dylan albums released since Rubber Soul as well as their own psychedelic experiences and this is the album where George Harrison really emerges as a strong songwriter in his own right. This sounds much more relevant today that Sgt. Pepper's.
pos,"""Sgt. Pepper's"" overarching concept of a variety show performance is, paradoxically, what makes it a totally cohesive and coherent album. ""Revolver"" has no such linking narrative, not even a sketchy and tentative one like ""Pepper's"", yet the LP is frequently held up not only as the greatest Beatles record, but one of the greatest records ever made. As a set of individual tracks which push the boundaries of pop's sonics and subject matter, ""Revolver"" is a significant release. But as a body of songs its legacy is less heartening because the Beatles now prize mature experimentalism over instinctive ensemble playing. You can hear it in the way elements of the songs sound cobbled together (much like the album's extraordinary cover art), and how the songs in different styles rub uncomfortably up against one another. The overall impression is that McCartney, Lennon, and the increasingly disingenuous Harrison (Taxman is a rich rock star's moan about, well, having to pay tax) are working more at odds to each other than is good for them, although, unlike on ""The White Album"", the Beatles are still capable of demonstrating a bit of discipline. With musicians of the calibre of the Beatles, it was too much to expect they'd simply knock out great songs in the studio, working together as a proper band, forever. But whenever I listen to ""Revolver"", I pine for the sound of the tight ensemble playing heard on past releases; and it is the sort of critical snobbery that arises from notions of 'maturity' in rock (a misnomer), and eclecticism and experimentalism as ends in themselves, which prevent truly great rock records like ""A Hard Day's Night"" being routinely elevated up to the kind of exalted status that ""Revolver"" so undeservedly enjoys."
pos,"The Beatles of 1966. Danger and death threats, dark shades and chain smoke. Before Sgt. Pepper and the Summer of Love, the Fabs crafted this lean and mean modern pop/rock masterwork. Supremely confident and at the peak of their powers, they left their contemporaries Dylan, the Stones and Brian Wilson miles in the rear view and set the bar for generations to come. Best songs. Best vocals. Best guitars. Best production. Ever."
pos,A mesmerizing piece of art that strengthens the foundations of a musical movement at the time. What was accomplished here is truly admirable.
pos,"I hate that people think Sgt. Peppers is the pinnacle of The Beatles work. It didn't get better than Sgt. Pepper they say. I disagree. Revolver is possibly the greatest album the group ever did. Tomorrow Never Knows, Yellow Submarine, Taxman, Got To Get You Into My Life (my favorite track on the album) Love You To, Elanor Rigby, do I need to say more? This was possibly the most important album they ever did. I don't need to go into detail since everybody knows how amazing Revolver is.It basically foreshadowed the Summer of Love with Pet Sounds. The group knew what they were doing and I absolutely love this album. Fantastic production that still sounds great to this day, a timeless classic. Trust me, Sgt Peppers is Awesome as well, but Revolver is five times better than Sgt Pepper."
pos,"I almost feel nervous giving the Album 'just' four and a half out of five, but I'll try and justify it as best I can. Perhaps the Songs have become so timeless, some of them from my own early childhood recollection (Yellow Submarine) I was aware of certain tracks before giving the Album a listen as a whole, so I subsequently feel the occasional temptation to skip certain ones. I also sense that the keenness from the group to experiment and push boundaries musically (which should only ever be commended in any case) perhaps detracts focus as to what sounds exactly they're trying to achieve here. I'm not saying the album sounds confused, but there are certainly a lot of cooks stirring the pot here (for want of a better phrase) which to me signifies contention and perhaps even slightly reluctant toleration of input from certain members. I understand that all of these are potentially (probably are in fact) exactly what makes this Album great, and maybe I should be interpreting the Album as a pioneering Audio experience rather than a Band simply putting out another Record. It's literally my favorite Beatles Album, feels a bit weird saying so after all that."
pos,"After all these years, this still seems like, song for song, the best album of the rock era. It was also the real watershed in The Beatles career, even if Sgt. Pepper had a deeper cultural resonance. The true great leap forward that ushered in an era, for better or for worse, of ""important"" rock albums."
pos,"I don't think I've ever seen a bad review of this album and I'm not about to buck the trend. The only song I could do without is Dr. Robert - but that's just a matter of personal preference. If you were looking for a perfect album, this is it.

I think this album also tends to mark the beginning of the shift from John as the dominant personality in the band to Paul. While John is by no means a secondary talent when compared with other contemporary artists, Paul emerges on Revolver as the stronger talent and I don't know that he ever relinquishes his hold within the band from this point forward."

pos,"Ha! They don't remember recording this one! Wheeeeeee! Our parent's generational poster-boys begin their long and winding trip through the newspaper taxis and the first taste is a dark one. The cover for this record is just about a perfect representation of what's inside...kinda confused and morphing, but still recognizable as coming from the throbbing melodic centres that the previous stuff was excreted from. Take, what I consider to be the quintessential Revolver song, 'Elenor Rigby', which contains nary a single normal rock instrument. It's all done by strings! That's right! The things your 5th grade orchestra class couldn't stop sounding like cats having their dermis torn from their subcutaneous muscle! And its all about sad and lonely old people and the weird rituals they go through to keep from feeling useless. Happy!

Now they do something interesting here (like they ever don't) ona few tracks, and take their Rubber Soul R&B/folk mix and fuse it! What a great idea! Like 'I'm Only Sleeping'...that strumming is pure folk rock (just slowed waaaaaaaay down) but that singing is pure Motown, man. 'Here, There, and Everywhere' does a lot of the same thing, but this time the singing is from the mid 50's doo-woppers rather than the mid-60's dancehall champions. Oh, 'Good Day Sunshine' is pure Lovin' Spoonful-esque cute optimism (thanks for the ray of light, Paul) folk rock, and 'For No One' is pure bummer folk-rocking, and 'Got To Get You Into My Life' is just 100% honkin' soul, so not everything undergoes 'the change', and really, all those songs I just listed are equally triumphant in my book.

For the songs that go way out to the Oort cloud, I shall nominate, but of course, 'Tomorrow Never Knows' as the top Beatles psychedelic song ever. And one of their top songs ever, period. And why? Take those backwards bird caws, that perfectly insistent, heaving funk beat, John's 'turn on your mind, relax, and float downstream' and 'love is all and love is everyone' and I see, IMHO, that all of their further psychedelia was simply attempting to recapture this peak. They never did it this cool again, not even on 'Strawberry Fields' OR 'A Day In The Life' OR 'LSD'. There's also 'She Said She Said', about Peter Fonda's acid trip, and its okay...but it's sorta just another song, you know? And 'Dr. Robert' is even more MOR than that. Bo-ring. For the Beatles. A highlight for 90% of the bands out there.

George's opening 'Taxman' is interesting, though, for besides it's itchy rocking nag, it also holds a sort of conservative social message (a Beatles first, both the social message and the conservative part, which was probably also a Beatles last). Weird huh? Maybe George should have run for MP on the Tory ticket. George's other weird tune on here is 'Love You Too', showing how far he's coming with those raga lessons on that sitar. But you know what? It rocks too, and not in spite of its Indian fetishism but because of it."
pos,"Revolver is a true work of genius, tackling both adventurous and more mundane material and excelling at both. The experimentation never hinders the melodies, rather enabling the melodies to go in new directions never thought possible, transcending the medium as a whole. Bereft of filler and infused with a healthy dose of the Beatles' special magic, Revolver is a timeless classic, a masterpiece that still sounds just as fresh today as it did decades ago, with Tomorrow Never Knows somehow sounding just as cutting edge as it had at its initial creation. For both innovation and melody Revolver can't be topped, making the album not only one of the Beatles' finest but likewise one of the greatest albums of all time."
pos,"Forgive me if I gush a bit too much in this review, but I'll just have to make this clear up front. This here album is, BY FAR, my favorite album of all time. PERIOD. When I took this sucker home after getting it from Best Buy and listened to it breathlessly four times straight before having to go, I knew from that point onwards that I would never again feel guilty about loving the Beatles. Anyways, I've tried to avoid going into too much detail about individual songs in the rest of my reviews for the group, but because I am scared that somebody might not actually be totally familiar with this simply amazing work of art, please allow me this indulgence.

In any case, if you don't agree with me giving the highest Beatles rating to Revolver, that's fine. Anything from Rubber Soul through Abbey Road is fine by me. But, I will tell you what I feel pushes Revolver over the top. While the individual songwriting abilities of the Fab 4 had yet to peak, this is the last time that I hear them truly functioning as a band. Sure, the bickering wouldn't start until The Beatles, but this was the last album where the band didn't have a true 'leader', if you get my drift. And with all of these monumental songwriting forces combined into one (along with producer George Martin, who deserves a TON of credit for this album), it should be little wonder that they produced such an incredible masterpiece. And with that I close. Amen."
pos,"Rubber Soul may be their first attempt on a more sober and complete album, but Revolver was clearly the departing point. Here, they find no limits to their creativity, expanding their ideas, breaking boundaries and find different perspectives and approaches to music. They started to use the studio as instrument, particularly using samples and loops, which was completely new at that time. But it was not only their approach which was different. Their sound was changing. They were rocking harder then before. And the mix of these two aspects result in their most psychedelic album. There are some highlights in this album (which rank quite high in their career as well), and fantastic individual performances. Ringo inventive percussion on ""She Said She Said"" is absolutely amazing and Harrison's guitar is incredibly tight, detailed and impeccable. John Lennon shines on ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" with his psychedelic deliver and Paul McCartney shows why he is probably the best melodicist ever on ""Got To Get Into My Life"". It may not be their best album, but it is their most adventurous, psychedelic and guitar driven one."
pos,"Another complete breakthrough by the Beatles - earlier advances were steady and significant but predictable, paralleled by those of other artists like Dylan and the Beach Boys. Revolver isn't as carefully crafted and relentlessly tuneful as Pet Sounds, but it's even more important, pushing the sonic boundaries of rock farther than any other LP in history. The Beatles combine startling studio wizardry (""Tomorrow Never Knows"") with inventive lyrical themes (John's ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and ""She Said She Said"") and unusual instrumentation (George's ""Love You Too"" - which kicked open rock's door to Eastern music). Paul is in top form (""Eleanor Rigby""; the brassy ""Got To Get You Into My Life""), George contributes the fantastically funky and ominous ""Taxman,"" and, of course, there's everyone's all-time favorite sing-along novelty tune - ""Yellow Submarine."" The single that immediately preceded Revolver (""Paperback Writer""/""Rain"") ranks with anything the Beatles ever did."
pos,"While Pepper would come to be regarded as a more culturally significant album, it wouldn't have been possibly without Rubber Soul and particularly Revolver. The only slight pity, at least for the band's personal artistic integrity, is that this turned out to be the final Beatles release that Dave Dexter would put his grubby meddling paws on. The Fab Four made sure that all changed from here on."
pos,"My favorite album by the Beatles. I really can't say there isn't a song that I don't like. Norwegian Wood is probably my favorite on the album. I just like the overall feel of the album. To me, every song is a classic. You can't go wrong with this album."
pos,"Rubber Soul was a turning point in the development of the Beatles, and sixties music generally. Faced with stiff competition from the likes of Dylan, the Beatles knew they had to abandon their earlier pure girly pop, and start to make music with more depth and substance to it. Rubber Soul contained the first excursions in that new direction, but still maintained the catchy and memorable nature of their earlier work.

What's remarkable about this album is that it sounds like it was written as an album, not just a collection of hits with fillers added to make up space. There's not one duffer on this album, every song is good and contributes something. Right from the beginning you can hear a change in their song format - songs were about something other than just love all the time (some of them contained humour, very unusual in pop at that time), and experimentation in musical style abounds. ""Drive My Car"" is a song not about love, but about ambition and materialism; it has the lads singing sound effects (beep beep) and a funny story with a punchline even (""I've got a driver, and that's a start.""). ""Norwegian Wood"" is about revenge (Lennon later said that when he lit the fire, it was the house that was set aflame ""isn't it good, Norwegian wood""), while ""Run For Your Life"" is about murderous revenge (Lennon was later sorry about this song, as it really is very misogynistic, but I suppose he made up for it later with ""Woman""). Many of the themes were quite thoughtful - ""Think For Yourself"" is self explanatory, while ""The Word"" forsees the psychadelia and the summer of love yet to come.

Musically, the Beatles began to try out different things - sitar on ""Nowegian Wood"", powerful fuzz bass on ""Think For Yourself"", a harpsichord solo on ""In My Life"" (and very pleasant it is too)! ""Michelle"" is a fabulous ballad from McCartney with French overtones, while Lennon went for a more German sounding ""Girl"", clearly feeling the competition from McCartney's song. But the Beatles' earlier sound isn't missing either - the chiming guitars, the tambourine, the harmonics, can all be heard on songs like ""You Won't See Me"", and Harrison's ""If I needed Someone"".

Overall, this is a great album, full of catchy but interesting songs, the Beatles at the very peak of their songwriting and musical powers. This album acts as an interface between the early and later periods, and combines the best of both. If you haven't got Rubber Soul, your collection isn't complete!"
pos,I just want to say that this is my first Beatles album I got today and the album is really great!
pos,"US or UK version? I think no other lp in the Beatles canon illustrates this debate more clearly than here. Both versions are great, but also different in feel. The UK's version has 4 unique songs ""Drive My Car"", ""Nowhere Man"", ""What Goes on"" & ""If I Needed Someone"". Left on the UK version, you have basically the next great Beatles rock lp. Those songs were cut & saved for the later US lp ""Yesterday & Today"" and in their place the Sides openers became ""I've Just Seen a Face"" & ""It's Only Love"" for the US lp. With the rockier songs cut, the US lp had a coherently folk-rock acoustic feel, setting a distinct mood.

Many prefer the US version. I think re-inserting George's ""If I Needed Someone"" to the US lineup would make the perfect Rubber Soul. Whatever configuration, these are peak first period Beatle songs & it's nice to shuffle them up a bit for repeated listening."
pos,"The Beatles returned from the US, partly psychedelicised, having been heavily influenced by Bob Dylan and the emerging folk rock scene. ""Nowhere Man"" sounds like it could be a Byrds Song and you can hear the influence of Dylan all over the album. Indian music had been influencing Jazz music in the US for some time, American rock stars were influenced by Jazz and Harrison picked up the Sitar in the US, making ""Norwegian Wood"" one of, if not the first pop tune to use the instrument. This album is rated highly on best ever lists, but amongst classics like ""Drive My Car"", ""Norwegian Wood"", ""Nowhere Man"", ""Michelle"", ""Girl"" and ""In My Life"" there are plenty of ephemeral, unmemorable tunes, rushed out to get the album released in time for the Xmas market, that either weren't any good in the first place (""What Goes On"") or that haven't aged well. That said, it's an important bridge between ""Help"" and ""Revolver""."
pos,"Rubber Soul is a giant leap forward for not only The Beatles, but the entire rock world. Expanding upon their sound, their words, and their use of the studio, this is the first album that sounded serious and exploratory in so many areas. An amazing degree of sophistication in not only the music but the lyrics. John and Paul are clearly exploring different avenues as musicians/writers, and those directions would expand on their unique gifts. George is becoming a much more creative force within the band and his musical expansion gives Rubber Soul such a diverse flavor. Ringo does sing What Goes On, but his timekeeping skills only help to enhance the overall sound of he and his bandmates. Key tracks are Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), Nowhere Man, Michelle, I'm Looking Through You, In My Life, and If I Needed Someone."
pos,"The Beatles had already made five fantastic albums, and it couldn't last - or could it? Yes it could! They even even made their best album with their sixth album RUBBER SOUL. The first Beatles album which was one of the BIG 5 albums. ""In My Life"" is my favorite Beatles song. ""Norwegian Wood"", ""You Drive My Car"", ""Michelle"" etc. In fact, I could list all the 14 songs from this album - they all are great songs. This is a perfect album. They had made more sophisticated pop with the album HELP! and it was time to make their peak album, a landmark."
pos,"""Rubber Soul"" marked a new period of development for The Beatles, illustrated by the sitar leads on ""Norwegian Wood,"" the harpsichord effect on ""In My Life,"" and Lennon's character portrait of ""Nowhere Man."" It exhibits not only a love for R&B, but also for the burgeoning folk-rock scene and exploding counter-culture. By 1965, the band was spending longer hours at the studio as both a refuge from the increasingly excitable outside world and as a place where their imaginations could flourish. As a result, ""Rubber Soul"" is a culmination of great depth, focus, and sophistication to create a startlingly original album."
pos,"The Beatles 6th studio album is without a doubt the most mature record of theirs. It shows the group moving on from the days where their albums were still great but filled with generic love songs and covers to more thoughful songs like ""Nowehere Man"" and ""Think For Yourself"" or songs that seem like love songs but have a dark humorous twist to them like ""Drive My Car"" and ""Norweigan Wood"" for example. Rubber Soul also marks the start of Paul McCartney's style of extremely meoldic bass playing that can't be ignored while listening (there are some earlier examples but most are singles like ""She's A Woman"") it adds a fun and enjoyable element to the listening experience, In addition to George Harrison's 12-string guitar folk rock playing style instead of his previous Carl Perkins style of playing that peaked in the Beatles earlier tracks, this album has very much a folk rock vibe to it which is quite a change from what we've been used to in terms of the Beatles. You can really feel the influence from The Byrds 1965 record ""Mr. Tambourine Man. Fantastic album, one of my favourites of all time, never not worth a listen."
pos,"Here we get the beginning of the Beatles musical renaissance. This is their only full on entry into folk, and it is utter perfection and a unique item in their catalog, despite not actually straying THAT far from their earlier sound. Before this point the Beatles were basically all about writing whatever song would sell, by now they conquered that market and got bored so they decided to perfect the art of making music and expand horizons. Here they dip their feet in the water before going head first on their next LP.

It's still clear at this point that John in the leader of the band, in position and songwriting ability. John delivers what are the two best songs in my opinion, ""In My Life"" which has a fantastic piano solo played by George Martin, and the absolute classic ""Nowhere Man"" the Beatles second song not to address love and it is strikingly personal. John was confused as to his direction in life and after a long writers block awoke at night with the song formed in his head. The harmonies in the song are also fantastic. Many people like to take issue with ""Run For Your Life"" (including John) due to its misogynistic lyrics, but it works for me for two reasons. Number one, it's aggressive lyrics make it stand out from their other 'I Love You' songs (and the lyrics in these songs lets face it are mostly secondary concerns anyways) and two, John was an angry jealous person, and that shows in these lyrics, making this one of the more personal Beatle-mania songs. Then there's ""Norweigan Wood"" with its sitar usage making it an anomaly, and it's no secret Lennon was on another level.

That's not to make it seem like John is the only pulling force however, as there are truly no bad songs as everyone in the Fab Four gets at least one highlight. Paul has ""Michelle"", where McCartney is right in his wheelhouse, recording sweet and soft love songs. ""I'm Looking Through You"" also has some fine guitar work. George contributes two tracks, one with some interesting fuzz bass (""Think For Yourself"") and another with a strong guitar riff (""If I Needed Someone"") much like his tracks on Help! they blend in with the Lennon-McCartney tracks as George had yet to carve himself a unique identity. Ringo gets ""What Goes On"" which lets Ringo do what he does best, excel as the sympathetic loser while the rest of the Beatles sing glorious harmonies. Even though ""Wait"" was a leftover from the Help! sessions, nothing sounds out of place and every song is worthwhile.

Despite all this, from my searches online Rubber Soul seems to be an underdog as a candidate for the Beatles best album, and my guess is that it's too artsy for the elderly crowd who doesn't care for their experimental days, but not revolutionary enough for those who admire the Beatles ability to change the world of music. But straddling these lines is what makes the album so charming. For most bands, this would be a career highlight, for the Fab Four, it was just another stepping stone to greater feats."
pos,"Almost entirely unlike anything The Beatles had done previously, Rubber Soul is a superior album that finally embraces intelligent songwriting, unique tonal blends, and subtle psychedelic tendencies over the lovey-dovey material of before."
pos,"After three years, five albums, two movies, and a fist full of ground breaking singles, the Beatles had changed pop music and rock and roll and how it was made. Astonishingly, they would spend the next two years wiping this progress clean and changing it all AGAIN. And this is the starting point for that phase in their career. 

The group would start exploring lyrical themes that went beyond boy/girl relationships here. John Lennon's songs especially would reach a new level of introspection thanks to tracks like ""Nowhere Man"" and the touching future elegy ""In My Life"". George Harrison's songwriting was improving; ""Think For Yourself"" was lyrically important in the context of his solo career as it depicts a struggle from a lack of spirituality before it became a part of his life, and ""If I Needed Someone"" has a strong Roger McGuinn influence. 

The most notable thing about this album as a whole is the expansion of the group's sonic palette. They had flirted with unusual instrumentation as far back as ""Don't Bother Me"" on their second album, but here all sorts of new things are tried. Of course, it's the first instance of sitar in a pop song in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird has Flown)"" after the scene in the movie Help! where a sitar group performs the song ""A Hard Day's Night.. French-inspired guitar lines decorate Paul McCartney's ""Michelle"". George Martin's piano overdub sped up to sound like a harpsicord in ""In My Life"". The piano sound was heavily compressed on ""The Word"". A fuzz box was attached to Paul's bass on ""Think for Yourself"". Yet even these experiments were lightweight compared to what was to come. 

Influentially, this album was starting to show rock groups that the album could be used to make a strong statement, and Brian Wilson took notice and delivered his own ""Pet Sounds"" as a direct answer. But this was only the start of what could be done in a recording studio given some magnetic tape and a little imagination."
pos,"The album that blew Brian Wilson's mind, Rubber Soul was the album that saw The Beatles breaking away from the good time Beatlemania sounds of their previous records. Granted they had already begun that process on their previous two records, and they still manage to provide a nice good time for a good part of the record, Rubber Soul has them being a lot more reflective, personal, and exploratory such as through the usage of sitar on the lovely, reflective ballad Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), the gritty soul vibes of Drive My Car, the funky rhythms and proto-flower power lyrics of The Word, the mature, baroque inspired life reflection of In My Life (of which, a cover version by Chantal Kreviazuk would later be used as the theme song to the late 90's and early 2000's era TV drama series Providence), and the utterly striking and revealing Run for Your Life, where John Lennon borrows lyrics from the rockabilly classic Baby Let's Play House to express his envious, violent character at the time (during which he infamously beat his first wife, Cynthia, something he openly admitted to doing later in life) where he waxes veiled threats through lines such as ""I'd rather see you dead girl, than with another boy"" while explicitly stating that he's ""a wicked chick,"" so naturally the albums ends on a rather unnerving note, something The Beatles had never done before. That being said, Rubber Soul is a major classic of 60's pop and deserves it's place as such for it's brilliance and influence."
pos,"The mystery that is The Beatles, with their hundreds of albums spanning a whole generation of time is slowly unravelling and dissolving in this tireless journey of mine. In fact, the group had only 13 albums recorded in just 7 years of its entire existence, and Rubber Soul is already their sixth, so I'm basically halfway through The Beatles! The 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die skipped ""Beatles for Sale"" (1964) and ""Help!"" (1965) - I suppose they wouldn't pick every single album from the English band. Rubber Soul comes out swingin' with the use of new and unconventional instruments in rock, such as harmonium, fuzz bass, and most notably, the Indian sitar on ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" [and plenty of cowbell and maracas on other tracks]. By now The Beatles began moving away from their love themes, incorporating some philosophical messages into their songs, no doubt attributed to their by now ""habitual use of marijuana"", with Lennon himself referring to Rubber Soul as ""the pot album."" Maybe all this grass also caused some paranoia that started to strain the relationship between John and Paul. Just you wait, LSD is coming! We are also beginning to see the mastery of an album format (as opposed to a collection of singles, or just covers) with the band's only second album with all original material. The title is a reference to a phrase ""plastic soul"" which was a coined term for soul music written and performed by white musicians. Wouldn't you know?"
pos,"Representing a giant artistic leap ahead both musically and lyrically for the Beatles, Rubber Soul took some of the subtler signs of maturity under the surface of A Hard Day's Night and ran with it on a riskier but entirely successful musical adventure. From a musical composition perspective, they began incorporating elements of cabaret, classical, folk, hard rock, and early psychedelia into their unmatched sense of pop songwriting. The instrumentation had branched out too, with piano, sitar, and a simulated harpsichord sound all prevalent on selected tracks. Lyrically, the songs were beginning to take a more reflective look at adult love, as opposed to the simple joys of holding hands. The aggressive ""Run For Your Life"" even threatens to murder a cheating lover, something that must have been astonishing to the those who were fans of the ""She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah"" days. Some of the Beatles' most timeless songs are present, but even more importantly, Rubber Soul showed the world of pop music that new possibilities awaited as the late 1960s approached."
pos,"Rubber Soul is the perfect combination of every great aspect of the Beatles. Many Beatles songs can feel slightly formulaic (i.e. their Beatlmania songs) or a bit too progressive (Revolver and beyond), yet Rubber Soul strikes a perfect balance with solid Rock/Folk performance accompanied by unique lyrics. Though the instrument selection is not as innovative as Sgt. Pepper?s, there?s a good amount of experimentation from the sitar in ?Norwegian Wood? to the subtle thumping of a matchbox in ?I?m Looking Through You?. The lyrics set a very melancholy tone that isn?t quite as obvious as the White Album. Sure, there are still songs about love, but there?s a lot more hesitance and sadness than their British Invasion era songs. ?Girl? and ?Michelle? discuss feelings of romantic detachment while ?In My Life? and ?Nowhere Man? reminisces what one has (or hasn?t) done with their life. The album is like a coming of age story and in this way acts as a great segue between the band?s pop albums to their more poetic and abstract albums. This transition is most clear on the album?s closer, an anti-love song telling a girl to ?Run For Your Life?. Quite a shocker from a band who wanted to hold your hand! It is one of the Beatles? finest pop, folk and psychedelic albums."
pos,"Rubber Soul, in case you can't read, refers to Soul Music, which was currently plaguing Britain so many moons ago in 1965, causing small children to do the 'popcorn' and the 'mashed potatoes' instead of their 'homework' as you and I well know they should be. And The Beatles got caught in the Soul Fog themselves (thankfully!) before going home down Folk Rock Way and ending up on Ballad Avenue like they'd planned. And dig that new car they're driving around...it's got all these bells and whistles on it like sitars and organs and stuff. That mechanic of theirs, that George Martin sho nuff is a mechanical wizard, you know. But thank God the Beatles know how to use all those aftermarket parts correctly. God knows what would happen if the Herman's delinquents got ahold of that stuff."

Best song: NOWHERE MAN

It's all in the title, man - it's all in the title. Not that the title actually means anything (apparently it's Paul's periphrasing of ""plastic soul"", which has little to do with the record contents either), but like John once said, it's just the first Beatles album where they actually thought about an appropriate title. And an appropriate photo, might I add - perfectly attuned to the trippy clouds gathering on the horizon. That's about all that can be said about the album's supposed conceptualism, but it ain't that insignificant, either.

For many people, Rubber Soul has sort of become the quintessential Beatles record because it's exactly midway through the ""early"" and the ""late"" phases of their career. I don't quite feel that way because, although I have no problems with the band combining styles and genres on their albums, I do have a problem with ""lightweight"" stuff sitting right next to the ""heavyweight"" stuff; in the Beatles case, I usually prefer them separately. (And by ""lightweight"" stuff I do mean 'Wait' and 'You Won't See Me', but not 'Yellow Submarine', so there). But nitpicking is one thing, and joining the ""sheepherd"" loudly baahing out that with Rubber Soul, the Beatles In Rock have arrived is another. So count me in, good shepherd."
pos,"Rubber Soul is a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest albums in rock history. Marrying the immaculate melodies of albums like A Hard Day's Night to more ambitious songwriting, arrangements and production, the Beatles crafted an LP far ahead of its time and accordingly one of the most influential albums of its era. While it would be an egregious mistake to dismiss its predecessors as inconsequential childish fluff, the Beatles didn't truly come into their own until Rubber Soul, when they elevated themselves from mere rock stars to four of the most significant, pioneering figures in musical history."
pos,"I must confess that, silly me, I didn't much like this album the first couple of times I heard it. Oops. Needless to say, time has corrected this little mistake and allowed me to recognize this album for both the masterpiece it is and as a huge quantum leap forward from Help!. Regardless of what happened, whether Paul actually died of a car accident and was replaced by look-alike William Campbell (one of the weirdest Beatles legends), or whether they all had some sort of religious transformation while in India, or if they finally got some high-quality weed, the fact of the matter is that after this album, rock would never be the same.

If you consider this the best Beatles album, I have no problem with that. This is actually my brother's favorite, and really, the melodies are fantastic from start to finish. I do feel somewhat bad not giving it a perfect score, but it gets as high of a 5 stars as any album is capable of getting. And just think, they only got better ... What a band.

pos,This to me is a Beatles greatest hits. I love every song off this album.
pos,"""Rubber Soul"" is a pleasingly expressive record, more notable for the advances in the song writing of McCartney (he's less sentimental) and Lennon than it is as a completely satisfying musical statement; although Lennon's introspective turn was first heard on the ""Beatles For Sale"" LP from the preceding year. The playing on ""Rubber Soul"" is the Beatles' most assured since ""A Hard Day's Night"", and a number of the songs are exceptionally strong (Drive My Car; Norwegian Wood; Nowhere Man; In My Life; If I Needed Someone; Michelle; Girl), although these sit alongside a handful of less memorable, but well-performed compositions (You Won't See Me; Think For Yourself; The Word; I'm Looking Through You; Wait) and a couple of duff tracks (What Goes On; Run For Your Life). Much has been made of the sparseness of the recordings and production on ""Rubber Soul"". But it has to be said that the Beatles owe Bob Dylan (and the Byrds) a huge debt on this album; and any advances in this direction were short-lived and transitory anyway, swallowed up as they were by the phantasmagoria of sounds and confusion of themes on ""Revolver"", and all the Beatles' subsequent album releases."

pos,14 gems and a turning point in music...the concept album is born...and a special personal album for me
pos,"What I like most about this album is how it coheres, despite the new diversity in word and sound."
pos,"The best 60s rock album produced up to this point, which is saying a lot - there was in fact some stiff competition (e.g., The Beach Boys Today). Although the Beatles were still often sticking to their tried-and-true love song format (the cutesy ""Drive My Car""; Paul's ""You Won't See Me"" and ""Michelle""), John is experimenting with anthems (""The Word,"" which summarizes the whole flower power movement two years before it even happened), as well as highly personal, almost diary-like sketches that rank among his most popular work (""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),"" the first prominent rock record to feature a sitar; the devastating ""In My Life""). It's all solid; even John's insecurely misogynistic ""Run For Your Life"" features a great vocal. The simultaneously released single (""We Can Work It Out""/""Day Tripper"") was arguably their best to date."
pos,"With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian ""When I'm 64"" seems like a logical extension of ""Within You Without You"" and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of ""Lovely Rita."" There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish, … la ""Help!""; ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of ""A Day in the Life,"" a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here."
pos,"Care to take a glance at my ?classic? albums"" Most of them have only been around for ten years or less. ?Classic?, right, it must sound suspicious. Currently in this day and age they are the shit to me, you know, and even have been for years ? but will they affect me in the same way in a decade or more from now"" Sometimes I wonder. Sometimes I wonder if any of my favorites are really all that time resilient, collections of music in and of themselves exceptional and moving, without having to have some then-and-now emotional attachment placed on them by the glue-like nature of my humanity.

Especially if you happen to be my age and have, when compared to your elders, only recently taken an adamant interest in music; are there really, really any ?classics? that you, beyond a shadow of a doubt, believe deserve the title, albums that you are dead-positive will not lose their appeal to your person in the coming years""

I have but one, and one only: Let me introduce to you the greatest album of all time, Sgt. Pepper?s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the sole album that I can deem a true ?classic? in my eyes with the assurance that it will never lose its favor with me. Its history, its mere impact as the defining album of psychedelic rock ?n? roll makes it deserving of the title alone, but as does the lengthy amount of time that I?ve personally known Sgt. Pepper?s for, from the time of my father playing it in the background while I was in the crib as an infant to even now to this day as I play through it over and over as I type. The melodies and the revolutionary instrumentation of The Beatles recorded in the Abbey Road Studios in 1967 strike a sequence of notes in my mind each time that I hear it, playing back each and every instance or circumstance in which I had heard it throughout my life. ?Classic?, indeed.

The Beatles took the experimental breakthrough of Revolver in 1966 and completed what they had started in their following eighth studio album, Sgt. Pepper?s ? that?s right, completed. Their works before and after it"" Damn ?classics? the lot of them, by many-a-standard, but a ?classic? of ?classics?"" There is your Sgt. Pepper?s: The greatest album by the greatest band the world has ever known. The Fab Four set out to record an album that would effectively ?tour? for them at a time when they had left the touring world behind to become a studio-only band. Little did they know that not only would Sgt. Pepper?s effectively hit the road for them; it would ?tour? for them constantly in the decades following the 60s as a landmark of studio production wizardly, expanding the recording palette of those artists at the time of its release and that of those to come in the future. 

Legacy aside, the case can be made that Sgt. Pepper?s is The Beatles at their best creatively as songwriters, not a dud of a track to be found on the concept of the album?s setlist. Even Ringo Starr?s vocal performance is among the best of his career, heading one of The Beatles? premier, noteworthy tracks, ?With A Little Help From My Friends?, a song written for him by guitarist John Lennon and bassist Paul McCartney. A little underrated in his work on Sgt. Pepper?s, and on the majority of The Beatles? other albums as well, is George Harrison; his inclusions to the songs, especially the Indian-influenced and penned ?Within You Without You?, are vital to the album?s diversity of instrumental material, featuring such foreign inclusions as a tambura and dilrubha.

Leaving the rest of Sgt. Pepper?s to the hands of Lennon and McCartney is perhaps the reason the album succeeds as well as it does, though, taken in a song-by-song context. The overcomer?s anthem ?Getting Better?, the aforementioned ?With A Little Help From My Friends?, the often critically underrated beauty of ?She?s Leaving Home?, and hello, perhaps a runner for the greatest song of all time, the revolutionary epic ?A Day In The Life?"" Lennon and McCartney at their best, prooving, if only by this album alone, that these two men were the greatest songwriting duo the world has ever known, performing the most cooperatively that they ever had together, a point that is all but cemented with just one play through of Sgt. Pepper?s enthralling closer. If only the singles released before the album were included into its tracklist, ?Penny Lane? and ?Strawberry Fields Forever?, then perhaps even the harshest of Sgt. Pepper's critics would bend to the album?s grandness as a sublime collection of songs and as a display of innovative studio wizardry. 

But on the other hand, Sgt. Pepper?s wouldn?t be the same then, now would it"" The album?s perfect layout that meets the differing songs of its content with a firm handshake and places each preceding in perfect union with the next would be changed. In short, the album just wouldn?t worklike it does now. Give me an album that smoothly transitions from the mallet-struck painette of ?Getting Better? to the harpsichord and maracas of the psychedelic ?Fixing A Hole?, that bridges the gap of the out-there Indian instrumentals of ?Within You Without You? with the nursery-rhyme ditty found in ?When I?m Sixty-Four?, as if mere elementary mathematics. It just can?t be found anywhere else, a flow so natural and perfect that only the songwriting and studio workings of the greatest band of all time, The Beatles, could make it work. Let?s not forgot the studio marvel that is ?A Day In The Life?, a profound multi-piece revolving around drugs, a friend of McCartney and Lennon?s death, and pot holes in the road, featuring that final E-major chord, perhaps the grandest single chord in rock ?n? roll history. Ever wonder for what purpose it sounds""

Completion, it is finished. The end to the best work that The Beatles ever made together. But not only this: The chains of convention and pop music had once again been broken by The Fab Four with Sgt. Pepper?s release and impact in 1967, but arguably on a larger scale. No longer were songs by a pop band limited to a two-three minute running time in order to be successful. No longer were unconventional instrumentals totally off-limits for the radio; the gates of the studio had been opened wide. As I listen to Sgt. Pepper?s now, I have nothing but gratitude for what it stands for today and for what it did back then in the 60s, but yet I respect it the most for the strength as a timeless collection of songs. They have never diminished in their strength to me, never once becoming skippable on a listen through the album's entire length. Sgt. Pepper?s is an album that I must listen to all the way through each time I hear it, to remember each instance in which I experienced it, but also to marvel at the brilliance of its creators. And you know what"" Every time I enjoy it a little more than the time before, perhaps a true indicator of Sgt. Pepper?s rightful status as a ?classic?, as the greatest album of all time:

?I?ve got to admit that it?s getting better; it?s getting better, all the time.?
"
pos,"The contemporary view was that this was not just the peak of the Beatles? career but the high point of recorded music to that date. Ringo remembered it less fondly as the album on which he learned to play chess.
It is where the Beatles really exploit the studio as the instrument, forgoing live playing for sonic adventure. It is impossible to overstate its impact: from a contemporary Sixties perspective it was utterly mind-blowing and original. Looking back from a point when its sonic innovations have been integrated into the mainstream, it remains a wonky, colourful and wildly improbable pop classic, although a little slighter and less cohesive than it may have seemed at the time.
Some songs, such as Lovely Rita, When I?m 64, Good Morning, Good Morning, Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite and Harrison?s dour, droning Within You Without You, seem undernourished excuses on which to hang florid ideas. But the title track is an improbable scorcher, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds a glittering gem, Fixing a Hole and She?s Leaving Home lovely chamber pieces, and the concluding A Day in the Life one of the strangest and most beautiful recordings ever, an inner-space odyssey juxtaposing Lennon?s ethereal surrealism with McCartney?s prosaic energy and wrapping it all up in an apocalyptic orchestral climax.

"
pos,"For me, as a child of 16 at the time, this album was an epiphany. I was totally mesmerized from beginning to end, and remain that way to this day. Hearing it now, remastered and on far superior sound equipment, I am still dazzled by the bass on Fixing a Hole, the story line of She's Leaving Home, and the fact that it launched so much of what came after means nothing to me. For me, this was IT!...the album that really weened me off classical and jazz and into the world of rock."
pos,This album isn't great. It's awe-inspiring. It is the most important album ever made. It transcends. It's like a William Blake poem book. It can be on both sides of the spectrum.
pos,"The huge historical impact of this album is without a doubt. In includes probably the best Beatles song ever made: ""A Day in Life."" But if you listen to it without the orthodoxy of the ""best album ever made""? Or without a knowledge of the historical context (admitedly huge)? There are indeed perfect songs at the start, from the intro to ""Getting Better"", but you will find there are also McCartney-by-numbers like ""Fixing a Hole,"" ""Lovely Rita,"" ""When I?m sixty-four"" that almost kill the album in the middle of its running time. Lennon was that time coping with his drug addiction and he was unable to balance this album with some of his strong tracks. I do not think anybody can seriously recognize his tracks like ""Mr. Kite,"" or ""Good Morning"" as his very best. He recovered artistically for the White album and there you will find ""Dear Prudence,"" ""Happiness is a Warm Gun,"" or ""Revolution"" - real songs of a genius he was. But on Sgt. Pepper? George Martin said it was a mistake not to include Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane on the album and he is right. The album could have been so much stronger. Album easy to admire for its historical value but pretty hard to love."
pos,"Well it was forty eight years ago today, that The Beatles made arguably the best album of all time under a pseudonym that pushed all boundaries and changed music forever...ay. Okay it doesn't fit the time measure needed for the first line but it has lots of truth to it. The Beatles took a softer rock approach than Revolver and tried even more unconventional instruments and concepts.

The intro track is a good rocker and sets the tone, entering the druggy and cheerful ""A Little Help From My Friends"" where Ringo once again assumes the role of the happy clown and for good reason, he is well fitted for it, and the Beatles provide great harmonies. We get ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" next, a Beatles classic for good reason, it's spacey and represents everything the psychedelic 60s embodied. The best songs here are the ones fair weather fans don't know. ""Getting Better"" is a personal favourite, not only because it's great guitar but because of the bridge where John and Paul collaborate, it goes from happy rocker to druggy, and the lyrics take a strange turn ""I Used to be Cruel to my Woman I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved."" It threw me for a loop when I first heard that, I couldn't even believe it was part of the same song. ""Fixing a Hole"" is just as pleasant, Paul sounds mesmerizing with ""Where It Will Gooooo..."" Follow this up with ""She's Leaving"" which is a gorgeous song by Paul and one of the saddest The Beatles recorded, about a runaway that is very symbolic of the rift between the counterculture and their predecessors, made all the more fascinating by focusing on the parents rather than the child.

John steps back in with ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" A song inspired by an old carnival poster and it is one of my favourites, it's a detour from the rock based sound most of the album has and is an example of how avant-garde can be used properly. Certainly better here than Rev 9. It's unfortunate George only gets one song (especially since ""It's All Too Much"" was recorded during these sessions) but his contribution ""Within You, Without You"" is as smooth as honey, a perfect usage of Indian music and it's philosophical musings fit perfectly with the era it was recorded in. After this we get two charming ditties by Paul (""When I'm 64"" and ""Lovely Rita"") that are both great, but despite that they'll always be remembered for replacing the super duo of Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields. Then there's ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" which I think has the weakest chorus but makes up for it through eccentricities. Then there's the reprise followed by

""A Day in the Life"". Greatest Beatles song ever? Possibly. It has Paul and John trading verses, a sweet acoustic guitar, and best of all a huge build up to a phenomenal climax. Most times I listen to an album I have to listen to it many times to appreciate it but with Sgt Pepper's it was once and I knew I heard something special. The Fab Four were never this unified again."
pos,"The Big Cheese. The Head Honcho. The King Rat. The Leper With The Most Fingers. Sgt. Pepper's has such an enormous, hulking historic value that to even approach it objectively is more or less impossible nowadays unless you live on a desert island. A whole generation of newly-freaky-in-1967 folks still get misty-eyed about this one, it's still a sort of coming-of-age record for a lot of young folks even today. Okay...I started on this road, and now I'm a gonna finish it.

So, see, the kids who were 13 or 14 when the Beatles first arrived, had their first date with Hard Day's Night (probably went to see the film), had their first heartbreak along with Beatles For Sale, started getting teenage angst with Help!, got wasted for the first times with Rubber Soul, turned 18 or 19 when this record came out and were totally open to the invitation to get 'turned on'. As the Beatles matured and went through their changes, the 60's and the kids did the same. And to explain what it felt like when this album was released, try to imagine your favorite band not releasing an album (not even a compilation!) for nearly 7 months, an unheard of length of time in the 1960's, during which time exciting and scary changes were happening to music, the world, and yourself at such a rapid pace that anything was possible from the Beatles in 1967. It was like the anticipation for the followup to Dark Side Of The Moon in the 70's, or to The Joshua Tree in the 80's, or OK Computer in the 90's, but even bigger...because in the 1960's, the Beatles were something that everyone agreed on. Nothing has happened like that since. According to the old folks I know, The Beatles were just the top of everyone's list. The Rolling Stones were for greasers, the Who was unknown, Dylan was for arty flakes, and who else was there? But everyone loved the Beatles, and everyone was waiting for Sgt. Pepper's.

And you know what? They delivered on their hype. The unforgettable, colorful album cover, the moustaches, the cardboard cutouts, the lyric sheet. It had A CONCEPT!! Image that! And the music...oooh, that music just hit all the right spots. Just ditching your square parents for an adventurous life on your own? You get 'She's Leaving Home'. Just taken your first LSD trip? You get 'Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds'. Just getting in the communal groovin' mood with your freaky friends? You get 'With A Little Help From My Friends'. Ruminating on the meaning of life and the falsity of 'normal' lifestyles? You get 'A Day In The Life'. It was an unstoppable machine. Everyone was talking about it, everyone was playing it, everyone was trying to understand it. And everyone else in the music world tried to imitate it. It was what everyone had wanted, and more."
pos,"I'm going to be brutally honest, I'm a Beatles fan and I really don't care for this album. It has some really cool sounding tracks like Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and A Day in the Life but to me it just seemed so empty, so full of style yet so lacking of substance (compared with their Beatlemania works and their post Sgt. Peppers works). It was sonically groundbreaking at the time and parts of it still sound cool as I just mentioned but if you ask me it just came off as this rather pretentious sonic experiment that only occasionally connected on an emotional or cerebral level."
pos,"Well, here it is, the most famous album in the history of mankind. As overrated by some as it is underrated by others, and while my opinion of the album is only a drop in the ocean of essays and critiques of it, here it is anyways. Is the album overrated? Sure. Is it the greatest album of all time? No. Is it the greatest Beatles album of all time? No. Is it the most 'experimental' album of all time? Not exactly. Is it one of the top ten or so albums of all time? Possibly. Is there anyway it will get less than a 5 stars on my overall scale? NO.

This album rules. When I first got it, I probably would have only given it, ehn, a 4 stars or so, but I was dumb. There have been greater albums in rock history, but not many. Buy it."
pos,"More than any album that had been made or will ever be made, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band transcends all boundaries and rewrites the books on how rock 'n' roll is and was supposed to sound. Having retired from the road, the album is both of and ahead of its time and the Beatles had completely mastered their craft and had used the studio to.their total advantage. Sgt. Pepper encompasses style, the psychedelic movement, the different musical forms, it defines perfection. While the Sgt. Pepper band is largely a Paul McCartney brainstorm, Messrs Lennon, Harrison, and Starr cannot be understated, for their contributions make the album whole and cohesive. All tracks are key to establishing the Pepper sound and to take one away would be doing it a disservice."
pos,This album is unique because it opened musical horizons for all the other artists that followed. The Beatles and George Martin introduced new elements into their sound that basically said anything goes in rock music. Boundaries were shattered and there was no looking back. It?s hard to demonstrate to the current generation the anticipation that we felt at the time when a new Beatles album came out. We always expected and got great music. Even when the Beatles did covers. Sgt Pepper exceeded our expectations by a margin that we hadn?t even measured. You can never know the thrill of sitting in your parent?s living room and listening to all that psychedelic music being played on a two speaker stereo system. Yes it?s flawed but there was nothing like it before and a lot of imitation after. This is why Sgt Pepper is the best album of all time. There are and will always be new contenders but only one can be the first one.
pos,"There's a reason this album is considered one of the greatest of all time. Because it is.

I love The Beatles and all of their albums. I've heard Rubber Soul, With The Beatles, The White Album, Let It Be etc. millions of times. But Sgt. Peppers is their masterpiece.

A stunningly consistent album from start to finish, this is the Beatles' ultimate achievement."
pos,"This is often to be said the greatest or the best album ever. It is a very good album. The Beatles was probably inspired by The Beach Boys who said they had made the best album PET SOUNDS which was inspired by RUBBER SOUL. Of course, like all the BEATLES fans know, ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"" are much better than PET SOUNDS by The Beach Boys. ""Pepper"" is also better. The Beatles's style had changed quite much and I understood that no one had made album like this before. ""With the Little Help from My Friends"", ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", ""She's Leaving Home"" and even the odd ""A Day in the Life"" are now classics. Still, there's songs as ""Good Morning"" and ""Mr. Kite"" which you had to just take by humor. ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is a song we used to listen to school while we were young.
"
pos,"SPLHCB is worthy of most of the hype that surrounds it, a brilliant album that pairs superb songwriting and ubiquitous clever experimentation, with the two complementing one another as opposed to clashing. While it may not deserve its reputation as the best album of all time, or even the best Beatles album of all time, it's nonetheless a true classic, and one that will endure for years to come."
pos,"The whole concept that there is such a thing as the greatest album of all time is silly. Silly, yes, but it sure is fun to postulate and argue our choices. Sgt. Pepper is one of the albums that has been historically mentioned in discussions of the greatest albums ever and as such has been subjected to a bunch of revisionist history nonsense. I understand it is a time honored sport to try and butcher sacred cows, but what I do not understand why in some corners it is believed that by acknowledging the greatness of one album somehow diminishes the greatness of another. Yes, I am talking about Sgt. Pepper?s vs. Pet Sounds and how often they are pitted against each other. I find this strange and sad since they are really kindred spirits of the 1960?s. What I know is that to me Sgt. Pepper sounds great, especially when listened beginning to end. I could go on talking about McCartney?s epic basslines, Lennon?s voice on A Day in the Life etc. but nothing I write will change anyone?s mind. Sgt. Pepper is a great listen. Simple as that. 

Another user review on AMG of Sgt. Pepper mentioned something John Lennon supposedly said about Ringo - ""Ringo isn't the best drummer in the world. He isn't even the best drummer in the Beatles"". I had heard this funny quote too, but recently found out that Lennon never said it.
From a story in the L.A. Times by Randy Lewis, Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn discredits this quote as having come from John Lennon: 

As part of his in-depth research, Lewisohn also has debunked a humorous knock on Starr?s drumming abilities, long attributed to John Lennon. For decades, people and media outlets have repeated the anecdote about Lennon being asked whether he considered Starr to be the best drummer in the world. The oft-quoted response: ?He?s not even the best drummer in the Beatles.?
While it sounds like the kind of acerbic comment that might have come out of Lennon?s mouth, Lewisohn says no.
?The London Times newspaper quoted John Lennon ?famously saying that Ringo wasn?t even the best drummer in the Beatles.? John Lennon never said that, famously or otherwise, and that is the London Times quoting him,? Lewisohn said, making a point about his motivation for trying to separate fact from Fab Four mythology.
?For me, it?s [a case of tracking down] when did he say this? I?ve heard every John Lennon interview, I?ve read every John Lennon interview, I never saw that quote. So when did he say it, let alone when did he famously say it?? he said. ?I determined to get to the bottom of it. And it?s actually a TV comedian?s joke from three years after John was killed, in 1983. So John Lennon never said it -- and wouldn?t have said it.?
The line often attributed to John Lennon - ""Ringo isn't the best drummer in the world. He isn't even the best drummer in the Beatles"" - was actually uttered by British comedian Jasper Carrott in 1983."
pos,"Great album from one of the greatest band of music history, Fabulous outro with A Day in The Life at end, so beautiful."
pos,"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is arguably the most important Beatles album, building upon the discoveries of Revolver while also being new and wholly diverse, and the mixing is far superior than in previous records."
pos,"Retired from touring permanently (although nobody knew it at the time), another extended rest, and time away from each other. Building even more on the majesty and accomplishments of Revolver, the Beatles reconvene in the studio and become purely a studio band. Pushing the boundaries even further on what a studio can do as an instrument unto itself, Sgt. Pepper is the ultimate culmination of what a rock album can be. The artistic statement of all artistic statements.

Yet, at the same time, the amount of technical achievement here can be a bit overwhelming. Sure, the songs here are among the best the band ever put out, but it sounds like it was recorded with another world in mind today. But that's not to diminish what the album is and what it did at the time of its release. It still stands as an extraordinary accomplishment.

While nothing here really rocks out like their earlier material, the songs remain mostly as catchy as ever. Paul McCartney turns in catchy pop like ""Lovely Rita"" and ""Getting Better"", channels the music hall with ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", spins another soap opera tale with ""She's Leaving Home"" and plays the carnival barker of sorts with the title track. John Lennon isn't quite as introspective here, turning out psychedelic fare like ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" and ""Good Morning Good Morning"". George's Indian mysticism continues with ""Within You Without You"". And Lennon and McCartney come together for the album's magnum opus, the apocalyptic ""A Day in the Life"" complete with druggy imagery, surging orchestration, and the final piano chord like a door slamming shut on the past and resonating into the future of rock music.

This is the album where rock ceased being pop and became what we know as classic rock. Revolver may be the Beatles' best album, but Sgt. Pepper is the supreme musical statement of all time."
pos,"Some things need to be said 

The Beatles were the biggest band on the face of the earth during the mid sixties. Having progressed from an energetic Beat band playing Rock N Roll songs in clubs to headlining across the world with a string of number ones, two feature films and millions of screaming girls at their tail. John, Paul, Ringo and George had managed to hit a chord with almost everyone, with everything that they touched turning to gold. The Beatles could tackle any genre imaginable and make it work. Rock N Roll, Blues, Folk, Baroque and even Avant Garde psychedelia. Off the path of their mega hit album Revolver, the band were dipping their toes into studio experimentation. With their song 'Tomorrow Never Knows', the band had successfully combined Psychedelic rock with several tape loops and effects to create a truly mesmerizing piece of music. Leaving their touring days behind and now working in the studio full time, expectations were colossally high for the Fab Four's next record. With the release of the Single 'Penny Lane' b/w 'Strawberry Fields Forever', two of the greatest songs of the 1960s, the band were dead set on delivering a classic. On the first of June, Sgt. Pepper's Lonley Hearts Club Band was unleashed upon the world. As expected the album was critically acclaimed, staying at the top of the charts for months and having a lasting effect on modern music as whole. Eventually it was voted as the greatest album of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, a highly prestigious honor. Even today Sgt Pepper continues to be lauded as a masterpiece that no album can touch. The gold standard. The cream of the crop as it were. 

Disregarding Sgt Pepper is seen as suicide in the music journalistic group. Sgt Pepper is something never to be critiqued. Never to be spoken badly of. While some critics have come forward denouncing the album, even other artists (Famously Frank Zappa stated that The Rolling Stones 'Between The Buttons' was a superior album) have taken pot shots at the album. I'm not going to sugarcoat my views because frankly in my opinion, Sgt Pepper is the most disgustingly overrated album of all time. Now that I've guaranteed my crucifixion, let me explain myself. I can appreciate this record for what it is. A step forward in musical history. In my opinion, It's not that good. While the production is slick and clean, the album is muddled with dropped ideas and an over all lack of adventure to it. Numerous McCartney Music hall pieces outway many of Lennon's and Harrison's tracks. Songs like 'When I'm 64' and 'Fixing A Hole' bring the record down compared to 'A Day In The Life' and 'Lucy In The Sky'. I don't hate this album but the Beatles perfected a wider range of tracks with Revolver the year prior, hosting a much wider range of genres and ideas, like Acid Rock, Baroque and even Jazz/Soul. Sgt Pepper isn't bad, but it's weighed down by its own ego and Paul McCartney's love for Music Hall "
neg,"Here's a review you never heard before... This is my least favorite Beatles album. Had the Beatles taken two songs out of this album and put them in ""Magical Mystery Tour"", St. Pepper would be a throw away album. ""Magical Mystery Tour "" would then be the greatest rock album of all eternity with nothing else even coming close. What are those two songs ? ""A day in the life"" and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"""
pos,"Maybe the best rock album ever. Maybe not. But buy it anyway.

Best song: hell, they're all great!

Ah, the most famous rock album of all time. In fact, it's so famous I just can't listen to it any more, which only further proves its greatness. This is the peak of the Beatles' experimentation, the peak of their psychedelic period, and probably the peak of their songwriting skills. So who cares if it's not rock music really, it's a blend of all possible styles. It's not that there are no guitars: it's just that they are completely overshadowed by strings, symphonic orchestras, mellotrones and lotsa stuff that was so new and original then and is so common and boring now. Hey, don't get me wrong: it's not the music they did then that is common, it's the music that others do now that is so.

Sgt Pepper was certainly not the most experimental album of all time, if you put a sign of equality between the words 'experimentation' and 'noisemaking'. What is really so crucial about Sgt Pepper is that it was this album, and not any other, that led serious music lovers, many 'classical snobs' included, to finally recognize rock music as a serious, independent trend in modern art. While Frank Zappa was too 'crazy' to be considered 'worthy', the Beach Boys spoiled all the fun with their Hollywood arrangements, and Bob Dylan was still primarily a lyricist, the Beatles did it exactly the right way, and nobody can get away from the fact. Sgt Pepper lives on!"
pos,"The ""Sgt Pepper"" album was recorded in a four-month span beginning in 1966. The advent of new studio techniques such as multitrack recording and pitch shifting [recording tracks at different speeds] as well as the band's increasingly diverse influences led to ""Sgt. Pepper's"" kaleidoscope of sound experiments {music hall, Western and Eastern classical, rock 'n' roll]. The album, from the pop-art packaging to the gapless track sequencing, successfully put forth the idea that music and art were synonymous"
pos,"Enough said about this by nearly everyone..I bought this album in 1974 [aged 13] and until today, after purchasing several other editions, it?s still one of my favourites. One of those albums that fills your head with every note of it. George Martin: R.I.P."
pos,"Revolver is still my favorite Beatles album, but the mono version of Sgt Peppers comes in a close second. Regarded as a masterpiece, the whole album was one of the very first concept albums ever made and it feels like you've been to a concert. A Short one, but a memorable one at that. I like the stereo version, but it's missing so much from the mono version. The mono version is the original and different from the always heard stereo version. She's Leaving Home sounds better, With A Little Help From My From My Friends is awesome in mono, A Day in the Life, The Reprise, all better in mono.

I suggest buying the mono vinyl reissue as it is one of the best sounding records I have in my vinyl collection. It is just a great album and a classic everyone has heard."
pos,"As a teenager, I have the luck of living in a time when I have great artists' entire catalogs already here and ready for me to listen to them. I can't remember how many times I've seen Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on ""Greatest albums"" or ""Best albums"" lists. After listening to it, and having listened to the compilation album 1 already I have to say this concept albums is a joy form beginning to end. The bright humorous atmosphere is greater than I can describe. The songs can go from ""serious"" stuff like She's Leaving Home to some delightful silliness like 
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. This is some amazing material and again, I feel lucky to live in a time where all The Beatles' music has been released already."
pos,"Since the release of the Beatles' ""Rubber Soul"" in 1965, pop music critics and fans have been in the habit of listening to an album not simply as a collection of individual songs, but as a total entity - as a work of Art. On these terms ""Sgt. Pepper"" is a superior release to the preceding ""Revolver"", because the overarching concept of a variety show performance and its song links pull the disparate threads of the Beatles' song writing and performance into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. ""Sgt. Pepper"" can't be called a great rock record, but that's only because most of the songs aren't rock (although the parameters of rock are in the process of being widened here). Which means ""A Hard Day's Night"" could just as easily bear the mantle of Greatest Rock Record Ever Made, although it depends on the criteria you are using, and what kind of experience you are looking for in a pop record. If technical achievement and creative innovation are the yardsticks, then ""Sgt. Pepper"" must beat both ""Revolver"" and ""A Hard Day's Night"" in the Greatest Beatles Album debate. However, if ensemble playing and overall quality of songs is more critical (something Beatles records from ""Revolver"" onwards sorely lack), then you might expect to find the best Beatles record among their earliest recordings. Happily, when it comes to actually listening to the records, the decision of which one to pick is a much easier choice; and each record can be enjoyed for its own individual qualities, which makes the task of searching out the best Beatles record unnecessary, and rather tedious, and not at all in the spirit in which the record was made; although, regrettably, it is the Beatles' reaching up for pop immortality on LPs like ""Revolver"" and ""Sgt. Pepper"" that led to an unhealthy preoccupation in rock with 'maturity' and 'growth', and making major statements. On ""Sgt. Pepper"" the Beatles, for all their flights of fancy, manage to keep proceedings down to earth - not too surprising with McCartney at the helm - although the slight edge in McCartney's lyrics in places may surprise listeners, and is one of the elements of the make-up of ""Sgt Pepper"" (along with the immaculate track order, and overall presentation) that lends the album rather more weight than its playful veneer might suggest."
pos,"For the first 12 songs, I really felt like The Beatles were nowhere. And if it were real, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band would be alien. I was amazed not only by the technical innovations, but mostly by the way in which they were used to elevate music. Every single one of these songs sounded decades ahead of their time. What we are witnessing here, people, is modern music's connection to the high arts. From now on, every single great record would aspire to this monolithic masterpiece. But the first to do that were The Beatles themselves. On the last song, ""A Day In the Life"", The Beatles came back, forever transformed; and from the heavenly realm of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band we were put back on earth were death, war and political turmoil is perennial. But this song ushered in a new beginning. Every single great album ever made from that time forward owes this! And for that, John Winston Lennon, James Paul McCartney, Richard Starkey and George Harrison - thank you! Thank you for making the greatest album ever!"
pos,"The first B artist in my collection was a classic and the next is probably the most classic of all the classics, The Beatles' Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Swiped from my dad's garage this is a '67 mono version that still looks and sounds incredible despite the odd scuff. 

What can you say about this album that hasn't been said already? Not a lot as it happens other than I like it."
pos,"The Beatlemania has officially dried up. The touring has ended and Harrison has even threated to leave the band after his six-week India soul-searching trip. In fact, The Beatles, as the rock band topping the Billboard charts, were nearly finished. Instead, an Edwardian-era military band emerged as an alter ego, for the very first conceptual studio album, giving the x-fab-four the freedom to experiment in the studio with pieces that could never be really performed live. And experiment they did, producing compositions that were more baroque pop, vaudeville, music hall, and even Indian classical music, then the standard psychedelic rock and pop of the era. Recorded on EMI's Studer J37 four-track, George Martin pushed the signal processing limits of the studio equipment, to shape the sound with more dynamic range compression, signal limiting, pitch control, and even ambiophonics (an effect creating a 'stereo triangle' binaural soundfield to virtualize a perception of the surround sound). The newly invented ""flanger"" nearly came out from Martin's joke that Lennon's voice has been ""treated with a double vibrocated sploshing flange...""Besides the many drug-induced references, from the now well-known ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" hidden acronym, to the ""Henry the Horse"" phrase, to ""Fixing a Hole"", the psychedelic era is also promptly displayed on the magnificent album cover, by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth - a kaleidoscopic collage of 57 photographs ""as a guidebook to the cultural topography of the decade."" With Paul McCartney, of course, being the Sgt. Pepper himself, his newly devised Lonely Hearts Club band produced a historically important album - a true artistic maturation and a fearless breakthrough that can only follow on the heels of the Revolver and Rubber Soul."
pos,"It's not perfect, but the role it played in the history of music cannot be disregarded -- this is an album that pioneered various production techniques, added to the rising idea that a rock band can be artists, and popularized the idea that an album can be more than just a list of individual tracks. The concept of the album and the way its conveyed falls very short (even some songs are clich‚ beatles), but it's everything else that is monumental. It's tracks like the very first two or last one that elevate this album as a landmark of the 60s."
pos,"Having already hinted at a huge leap forward in popular music with Rubber Soul, then made a large stride towards it with Revolver, the Beatles had an opportunity to create the album that would forever change the game and permanently etch them into the history books. They didn't pass it up.

From the vast intelligent combinations of different musical styles that had either come before or been recently discovered in the West, to the album being released identically Worldwide without exception (yes, including on Capitol in the U.S.), Sgt. Pepper wiped the slate clean and drew up a fresh one, to the Fab Four's own grand design.

It's an album that produced no singles, yet still feels as though it is packed with hits that will never, ever be forgotten. This really is the greatest studio rock band of all-time and right here, on the greatest studio rock album of all-time, is nearly 40 minutes' proof of it."
pos,"Hmmm...seems like many people hates the album...but it's only because is regarded as the ''greatest ever'' and they got angry...
To me,it's just another masterpiece in the Beatles string between 1965-1969...sure,Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever maybe should have been included BUT there's no mediocre and bad songs on the album.,every song ,every second means something.
...Now, is better than Dark Side of the Moon for example?
WHO F... CARES????
That's not important...to me,album rankings are USELESS,capricious,and...stupid ...don't break your head in that thing...art is not sport.
Just play the record on your CD player (or turntable),crank up and enjoy.man.
UPDATE the 2017 remix is awesome."
pos,"One of the greatest albums of all time, Sgt. Pepper is a masterpiece. From the opening notes of the title track to the final note of ?Day In the Life,? the listener is taken on a journey filled with various characters each with their own tale to tell. There really isn?t much that needs to be said other than it should be mandatory listening in music education classes everywhere. A small note: if you haven?t picked up the remixes release from 2017, do so. Everything is enhanced yet the original remains. Highly recommended."
pos,"With Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the Beatles fully shed their mop-top image and the ""She Loves You"" era of their music. They fully immersed themselves in the studio experimentation and psychedelia that had been increasingly present on Rubber Soul and Revolver. Sound effects, Eastern influences, looping, orchestral music, sitar, calliope, and a host of other techniques, sounds, and instruments are brought into play on the group's most conceptually ambitious record to this point in their career. Despite all of these additions, Lennon and McCartney had lost not of their unrivaled pop sense as songwriters, and thus songs like ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" and ""A Day in the Life"" feature melodies as infectious as anything from the ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" days. The sonic leap forward that this album made established it as a historic record and one that inspired much to come on the rock and pop music fronts, but it was the high quality songwriting of the band which truly makes the record arguably the most enduring pop record of the prolific 1960s."
pos,"The most famous rock record in history, and it deserves most of the acclaim. What seems to have been forgotten in all the hoopla is that the songs mostly just expand and consolidate earlier innovations that were played out on Revolver - showcases of complex orchestration (""A Day In The Life""), abrasive, slice-of-life rockers (""Good Morning Good Morning""), giddy 60s anthems (""It's Getting Better""), bizarre studio experiments (""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite""), George's Indian-influenced pearls of wisdom (""Within You Without You""), and especially the lush psychedelia that John had mastered (""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds""). Even ""She's Leaving Home"" is a bathetic rip-off of the more sincere ""Eleanor Rigby,"" and the title track's booming, unstoppable herd- of-elephants sound is mirrored by ""Taxman."" Say what you might, though, the record did blow open the 60s like a double-strength hit of Purple Haze."
pos,"As we are soon facing the 50th Anniversay of this epic album, I want to be brave and bring some critic to it.
Yes, It?s one of the 20th century?s most epic albums, but by summer of ?67 musically the four boys 
already had peaked.
By listening very closely to it, you can find that it?s true.

Nothing on this album - Including ""A Day In The Life"" - can match ""We Can Work It Out"", ""Paperback Writer"", ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"".
Surely John Lennon was true, once he proclaimed the so called concept was kind of an illusion.
His numbers was totally taken out off context, never ment to be part of A coherent line.
You know that?s true, otherwise the Fab?s would have interlaced all the tracks, not just Pepper/Friends.

Of course there?s brilliance here. No doubt. 
But the mythical that followed the new-thinking package promised a lot.

Why - for an example - did McCartney even bother to pick up ""When I?m Sixty-Four"" ?!
They let Harrison in to show the world his new hobby; Indian way of self awareness.
OK! George?s track is very New-Wave of some kind, but hardly amusing for the masses.
The sitar became trendy, of course, and opened up the ears for many people, to so called
World Music.

The Beatles were facing heavy drug abuse by this time.
It reflected clearly on the music; some masterminds gave the world a blurry mix of remembered
songs mixed with self-absorbed half-ass crap.

If I would have been in my teens by the end of the 60?s, surely this album would have been 
so much more affectionately worth to me.

The Last recording years of the Beatles gave us very much memorable songs.
On the ""White"", and ""Abbey"", for example.

They owned the musical world in 1967.
But as I said in the beginning of this text; they had already peaked by then, in the artistical matter.

No fence to hard core admirers of this classic album.
"
pos,"This album may have been revolutionary and groundbreaking when it came out, but today it feels a bit rudimentary, and is totally left behind by much better music by the likes of Ed Harcourt, Annie Lennox, Heather Nova, Midge Ure, Mike Scott, Morrissey, Sting, and many others."
pos,"I've always been a bit confused as to why this is referred to as a concept album, and it appears John Lennon and Ringo Starr didn't think it was either! I can hear how this would have sounded very fresh back in 1967, the production is ground breaking, but have always been shocked when I've seen it hit number one spot on Greatest Ever lists. When John Lennon was asked if he thought Ringo was the best drummer in the world, he responded by saying ""he's not even the best drummer in the Beatles"", and if I'm asked if I think Sgt. Pepper's is the best album in the world, I would respond by saying I don't even think it's the best Beatles album! ""A Day In The Life"" is a brilliant song, this does still sound fresh today, but other than that nothing else is that great. The title track is a good rocker, and ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" is obviously memorable as is ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" (although Joe Cocker's version is much better - why do they ever indulge Ringo by letting him sing?). This is obviously a very important record in the history of music, I guess for many people who were alive back then it's worth listening to for nostalgic reasons alone, but most of the songs are forgettable and this is not something I would play all the way through."
neg,"Most overrated album in music history and worst Beatles album. Except for the opening three songs, the rest is a distilled bore."
neg,The most overrated piece of overrated garbage ever to be overrated.
pos,"It was the summer of 1964, and it had been a whole three months (!!!) since a new Beatles album from Capitol Records -- The Beatles' Second Album, assembled from various sources -- had been released to eager U.S. fans (and topped the charts). In the meantime, in addition to doing a tour of the U.S., the group had released their debut movie, A Hard Day's Night -- but the U.S. rights to the soundtrack were owned by United Artists Records (that was, in fact, the basis for United Artists' original interest in producing the movie), which had duly released its soundtrack in late June (and saw it top the charts). Capitol didn't have the soundtrack rights, but it was allowed to use most of the songs from the film; and as it turned out, the Beatles had delivered as fine a body of songs for the movie as they had for any of their albums up to that point -- songs that, as Capitol executives soon discovered, worked just as well in their combination. And so Something New was released about a month after UA's soundtrack, and if it wasn't as strong as the two preceding U.S. albums, in any other context and circumstance it would have been a contender for best rock & roll album of the year. Grouped alongside the band's hard-rocking, first-rate covers of Carl Perkins' ""Matchbox"" and Larry Williams' ""Slow Down,"" and topped out with their German-language rendition of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" (""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand""), which probably couldn't fit anywhere else, the Hard Day's Night material sounded fine, and few fans seemed to mind paying twice for the songs that overlapped between the two albums. And no one seemed to notice that this is where the 11-song Beatles' album comes into being, Capitol reasoning out that their material was so strong that they could get away with shaving off one track from the standard dozen, which became routine in the two years of U.S.-created releases that followed.
Actually, outside of the context of the film for which they were written and recorded, the Hard Day's Night material showed a remarkable growth in the band's range and sound in just a few months. George Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker guitar, which was the group's biggest sonic innovation in the movie score, was a little reduced in profile without the movie's title track on hand, but it was still present, as was an unprecedented (for a rock & roll group) reliance on acoustic guitar sounds (""And I Love Her,"" ""If I Fell""), and a range of ballads that showed greater emotional depth and seriousness than had been heard from too many rock & roll bands in 1964. And then there were the songs -- ""Anytime at All,"" ""Things We Said Today"" -- that melded rock & roll with acoustic and low-wattage electric music into something uniquely exciting, although the better-represented showcase movie title track wasn't here, With the rocking ""Matchbox"" and the exuberant ""Slow Down"" punching up the middle, Something New gave fans their money's worth and then some, even if it was just a transitional collection in the history that followed.

"
pos,"The only Beatles album that could really be classified as inessential, mostly because it wasn't really a proper album at all, but a soundtrack that only utilized four new Beatles songs. (The rest of the album was filled out with ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" and a George Martin score.) What's more, two of the four new tracks were little more than pleasant throwaways that had been recorded during 1967 and early 1968. These aren't all that bad; ""All Together Now"" is a cute, kiddie-ish McCartneysingalong, while ""Hey Bulldog"" has some mild Lennon nastiness and a great beat and central piano riff, with some fine playing all around -- each is memorable in its way, and the inclusion of the Lennon song here was all the more important, as the sequence from the movie in which it was used was deleted from the original U.S. release of the movie (which had no success whatever in the U.K. and quickly disappeared, thus making the U.S. version the established cut of the film for decades. George Harrison's two contributions were the more striking of the new entries -- ""Only a Northern Song"" was a leftover from the Sgt. Pepper's sessions, generated from a period in which the guitarist became increasingly fascinated with keyboards, especially the organ and the Mellotron (and, later, the synthesizer). It's an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments. Its lyrics (and title) on the one hand express the guitarist/singer/composer's displeasure at being tied in his publishing to Northern Songs, a company in which John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the majority shareholders; and, on the other, they present Harrison's vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside-out and the outside-in, during the psychedelic era -- the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967. And then there was the jewel of the new songs, ""It's All Too Much."" Coming from the second half of 1967, the song -- resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar -- was a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia, and was actually superior in some respects to ""Blue Jay Way,"" Harrison's songwriting contribution to The Magical Mystery Tour; the song also later rated a dazzling cover by Steve Hillage in the middle of the following decade. The very fact that George Harrison was afforded two song slots and a relatively uncompetitive canvas for his music shows how little the project meant to Lennon and McCartney -- as did the cutting of the ""Hey Bulldog"" sequence from the movie, apparently with no resistance from Lennon, who had other, more important artistic fish to fry in 1968. What is here, however, is a good enough reason for owning the record, though nothing rates it as anything near a high-priority purchase. The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP (an idea the Beatles even considered at one point, with the addition of a bonus track in ""Across the Universe"" but ultimately discarded)."
pos,"Essentially 4 new Beatles songs. John's ""Hey Bulldog"" is a killer & a fan favorite. Paul's ""All Together Now"" is fun & pleasant enough. George's 2 Indian are pretty good & deserve official release. Side 2, George Martin's instrumental are ok but not indespensible.

Again, this is really just 4 new songs & for most serious Beatle fans it was bought for 4 good songs found no where else."
neg,"Weirdly compiled, Yellow Submarine provides little context for those who haven't seen the film, but other than some tacked on tracks like ""All You Need Is Love"" and the title track, the soundtrack part of this album is not all bad, and worth listening to for hardcore Beatles fans--maybe more so for those who've seen the film."
pos,"Released only weeks after the White Album, Yellow Submarine is the soundtrack to the cartoon movie, and its only redeeming features, if you own everything they released from Revolver through the end of 1967, are four tracks not found anywhere else. The rest of the album, Side 2, consists of an orchestral soundtrack re-recorded for the album by producer George Martin.

Of the four new tracks, ""Only a Northern Song"" is a George Harrison outtake from Sgt. Pepper, ""All Together Now"" is a pleasant kiddie singalong by Paul McCartney, ""Hey Bulldog"" is a fierce piano-driven rocker by John Lennon, and ""It's All Too Much"" is a spectacular Magical Mystery Tour outtake from Harrison that arguably should've been on that album in place of ""Blue Jay Way.""

A couple of side notes: mono mixes of the four new tracks were prepared for a possible EP release instead of the album as we know it, along with an early mix of ""Across the Universe"", but the mixes were shelved and didn't see release until 2009 with the mono ""Past Masters"" volume in the ""The Beatles in Mono"" box set. They weren't even used in the UK mono version of this album, which used stereo fold-down mixes instead."
pos,"While the inclusion of 4 new great songs is definitely awesome, this doesn't have quite enough reasons to exist aside from just being a fair soundtrack album and little more."
pos,"I made my whole family watch the movie as I recorded it on cassette tape the first time the YELLOW SUBMARINE played on network TV. There was no video of anything at that time. So the only way to get the movie was to record it off the Telly : ) I'm still mad that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds got cut in half because the 30 minute tape ran out in the middle of the song. 

I'll never forget seeing the movie for the first time with my cousin after my aunt dropped us off at the theater. It was like going to another universe. When I hear the instrumental part of the YELLOW SUBMARINE, I am magically transported back to that time. What a treat"
pos,"Really, really, really unnecessary soundtrack album to the goofy cartoon of the same name, Yellow Submarine collects a side full of George Martin orchestrated soundtrack music (with monikers like 'Pepperland Laid Waste', giving you some idea about the content of the cartoon if you don't already know. Eh, the movie is cool.) which is okay but, you know...its sorta like watching a movie with your eyes closed. Actually, it's exactly like that. The original songs on here, and by that I mean 'Beatles '67-'68 outtakes', aren't any great shakes neither. Paul's 'All Together Now' is 'All You Need Is Love' with a helmet and a drooling problem, the George songs are long and worn out ugly psychedelia like 'Blue Jay Way' without the charm, and 'Hey Bulldog' is, well...it's Quite Allright! But, c'mon. You don't need to shell out $15 for four new Beatles songs when there's starving children and Flaming Lips out there for you to buy."
neg,"This is actually a soundtrack - from the well-known cartoon, and it suffers. It suffers because there are only four new songs here, moreover, at least half of them were outtakes from preceding works ('Only A Northern Song' is a Pepper outtake, and 'Hey Bulldog' was first recorded in the beginning of 1968 at the 'Lady Madonna' sessions). Furthermore, not all of the songs strike me as being masterpieces: George's 'Only A Northern Song' and 'It's All Too Much', for instance, share the flaw of being aimlessly overlong - their psychedelic atmosphere was slightly dated even for 1968, and there was absolutely no reasons to extend them to such long running times with 'groovy' jams at the end. That said, the melodies are very nice, especially the one in 'It's All Too Much' that's just as catchy as anything George ever wrote. But, in all honesty, the coda, with the band chanting 'too much, too much, too much' as if they were reprising that unhappy Elvis tune, is really, really overlong. It almost seems as if they were painfully trying to stretch and stretch and stretch the songs so as to fill up an entire side - a trick that the Beatles rarely allowed themselves. Meanwhile, Paul's 'All Together Now' is almost universally despised because of its utter childishness - and yes, it does resemble a nursery rhyme with its lyrics, but you can't deny the 'stupid' magic of the melody! Count it like another 'Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da': sancta simplicitas, if you know what I mean.

Oh, and one more thing: the long-time plans of a new overhyped re-release of this album that would eventually include some new previously-unheard-of Beatles song have finally come true, and I must warn you: if you really want this record, SEEK OUT THE ORIGINAL. The new rerelease is nothing but a straightforward collection of tunes from the cartoon, with nothing that can't be found on other records. No bonuses, nothing. Logical resolution: I'd rather have my Yellow Submarine with its George Martin instrumental side that never really spoils the general atmosphere, than have pointless reduplications of Beatles songs on other albums. After all, if I really want to have a trustworthy soundtrack, I can always make myself an audio tape and be happy with it (actually, I'd already done that in the past). This is just another in a series of shameless plans to rob Beatles fans of their money. Shame on you, Capitol Records!"
neg,"While not a bad album Yellow Submarine is riddled with defects, with too many prominent omissions to cast it as a viable greatest hits package and far too much overlap to recommend it to fans familiar with the Beatles catalogue. While three decent tracks and one true classic are enough to warrant a passable rating, it's hardly something that anyone save Beatles completists should have a need to track down, thus branding it as the group's worst album released while the band was still active."
pos,"The soundtrack to an infamous movie of the same name, it gets a REALLY low grade for a Beatles album. The biggest problem with it, of course, is that there are only FOUR new Beatles songs on here - the rest are either taken from previous albums (Yellow Submarine, All You Need is Love) or are the product of George Martin. The pure classical stuff from Martin here isn't that bad, actually - it's no Beatles, yeah, but many of the themes are quite fun to listen to. The fully orchestrated Yellow Submarine in Pepperland, for instance, or stuff like Sea of Time and March of the Meanies create all sorts of neat moods and have melodies that I'm perfectly happy to listen to. It can be a bit hard to take a full 17+ minutes of it if you're in a ""Beatles mindset,"" but it's hard to find anything really wrong with it from a musical standpoint. Not groundbreaking at all, but very nice.

All in all, though, the album is a fairly interesting listen, just because of the whole ""serious + goofiness"" vibe of the whole thing. I actually think the album could have been more interesting with the ""real"" songs interspersed with the orchestration instead of cleanly seperated, but hey, that's what playlists are for. And hey, at least this is a REAL ALBUM, as opposed to the reissue which is just a compilation."
pos,"Listening to this in honor of George Martin, whose original scored song are enchanting on ""side 2"" of the album. Obviously will be better for any buyer if you've seen the movie, and should be purchased in conjunction with Yellow Submarine Songbook, which has all of the Beatles songs that were included in the movie. RIP, George Martin!"
neg,"A major ripoff. Only six Beatles tracks, two of them are recycled from earlier records (title track; ""All You Need Is Love""), and the entire second side consists of assorted George Martin elevator music instead of the pile of additional tunes that appear in the film. And the four new songs, mostly from early 1967, are of variable quality. The child-like, acoustic ""All Together Now"" and raucous early 1968 heavy rocker ""Hey Bulldog"" are amusing but silly knock-offs, and Harrison's two tracks are fascinating and clearly serious efforts (""Only A Northern Song,"" which almost made it on to Sgt. Pepper's; ""It's All Too Much""), but weighed down by layers of freaked-out instrumentation."
pos,"Another hit from the British sensation. Only a third album from the Beatles, but this one had finally all original songs (still unusual for a record at that time), mostly composed John Lennon, although McCartney is also credited with four tracks, most notably ""And I Love Her"". The rest is a beautifully crafted production, moving away from some previously covered rhythm & blues and rock & roll to what has eventually become the British Invasion flavour of contemporary folk-rock. ""A Hard Day's Night"" is the de-facto soundtrack to a same-titled mockumentary / musical comedy, featuring the band dealing with the Beatlemania (I tried to watch the film, and didn't really find it funny - the dialogue with Paul's grandpa was just painful. Shall I give it another go?). The songs, of course, are all fantastic - with Lennon's acoustic guitar, Ringo's driving rhythms, George's 12-string electric Rickenbacker, plenty of cowbell, and Paul's layered vocals (taking deep inhales before each lyric and all). Most likely a must for any vinyl collector "
pos,"The first Beatles classic. A Hard Day's Night is the crystallization of the early years of the band, and the early peak of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team. Though George and Ringo were not songwriters in the beginning, their contributions cannot be understated as they bring so much to every song. After being so profoundly influenced by 50s R&B and pop stars, the influence of their contemporaries really begins to shine through on A Hard Day's Night. The album is a testament to making good use of little time and this where the Beatles slowly begin branching out. Key tracks are the title track, I Should Have Known Better, If I Fell, And I Love Her, Can't Buy Me Love, Things We Said Today, and You Can't Do That."
pos,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better album in the Beatlemania era. ""Please Please Me"" and ""With the Beatles"" were solid albums, but there were some obvious filler tracks, and half of the tracks on those albums were cover songs. ""A Hard Day's Night"" is an excellent album from start to finish. All 14 songs are original, a huge landmark for the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team. ""A Hard Day's Night"", the album's opener and namesake, went from a Ringoism to one of the greatest rock songs ever. There's plenty of other great John Lennon rock songs on this album, like ""Any Time at All"" and ""Tell Me Why"". While the rock songs on this album were great, my 3 favorite songs are all slower, yet beautiful songs. ""And I Love Her"" is the pinnacle of this album, as it features amazing vocals from Paul McCartney, and how about those bongos from Ringo? Anyway, ""If I Fell"" is my second favorite track on this album. It features beautiful harmony between Paul and John. Here's a song that constantly gets overlooked though: ""Things We Said Today"". What a pretty song from Paul McCartney. Even my least favorite track ""I'll Cry Instead"" is pretty good. That goes to show you how fantastic this album is."

BWAAAAAAANNNGGGGG!!!!

Now that that's settled, this is Beatlemania and all its glory in a nutshell. It's a very short album (30 minutes) but that removes it of any filler, never leaving room for a dull moment. We get a couple of ballads, but for the most part we get lots of high energy numbers.

There's the classic intro, ""A Hard Day's Night"", with its legendary opening chord played by George on his 12-string, and some nice back and forth with Paul and John before having an equally epic guitar fade out at the end. The energy doesn't die as we get the best harmonica in the Beatles career with ""I Should Have Known Better"". John launches into a ballad after this with ""If I Fell"", which seems much more like Paul's wheelhouse rather than John but it works here, John would largely avoid these Paul-esque songs for the majority of his tenure with the Beatles. We also get the underrated ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" another quick tempo rocker, I love listening to George's moments and he continues to shine here.

Then we get ""And I Love Her"" which is another classic Beatles song, the choice for Ringo to play bongos instead of drums is absolutely exquisite and apparently it was George who came up with the opening guitar part that Paul would later claim ""was the song"" on George's autobiography (Living in the Material World). Paul was always an expert at ballads and while sometimes it would get overdone this is the first time Paul pulls it off perfectly. Not as good as ""Yesterday"" but a fantastic precursor. John follows this with the decent ""Tell Me Why"" which is in my opinion the weakest moment of the otherwise flawless first half, but Paul picks things up again with ""Can't Buy Me Love"". The latter song features some excellent drum work by Ringo.

I will say however that in my opinion the first half is much stronger than the second half, or at the least there's less classic Beatles material. We do still get ""Anytime at All"" which has a fantastic tempo, but even better than this are the more low-key songs that probably weren't happy or sweet enough to make it into the movie. The two to highlight are ""Things We Said Today"" and ""I'll Be Back"" as they both manage to strike a middle between fast pace and slow ballad that makes them stand out against the other Beatlemania tracks. The only track that this album probably would have been better without is ""I'll Cry Instead"" which the clumsy lyrics kind of kill for me, they're a little too downtrodden for a song with such a happy tempo, but I'm nitpicking as even this song isn't all that bad.

I've kind of been repeating myself but that's because A Hard Day's Night has very similar songs in many aspects, most are all fast paced, good rockers, great harmonies, just perfect Beatlemania. If you're any kind of music fan you need to listen to this, and the movie is pretty good too."
pos,"This is the first album by the Beatles to contain all original material. From the opening chord of ""A Hard Days Night,"" you get to experience what was easily one of their best early albums. My favorite track is ""Things We Said Today."" But, they are all top notch. This album needs to be in the collection of any serious rock or pop fan."
pos,"The sound of Beatlemania. The first to feature all original compositions. As far as pop albums go, this is a classic and may have even influenced Dylan."

neg,"""Believe"" me when I say Justin Bieber is a talentless loser. If not for Usher, Bieber would be working at McDonalds. Believe is Bieber's worst album to date. He gets worse and worse with age. Justin Bieber's Baby become a viral hit for being terrible just like Rebecca Black's Friday, Soulja Boy's Crank That, and Psy's Gangnam Style. Only bad songs become viral hits. Justin Bieber's 15 minutes of fame are almost up and he will become a washed up loser like Lief Garret. He'll be constantly in and out of rehab and constantly getting arrested and getting ridiculously light sentences. Bye Bieber. The next stop for you is Celebrity Rehab."
neg,"This album does not disappoint its a new sound for Justin and shows are more mature side to him and he represents what he does well by showing variety within his vocals this album has converted my friends into beliebers. The best songs in my opinion are 'thought of you', 'all around the world' and 'beauty and a beat' and the overall best in my opinion is 'die in your arms' but there is not a single track that I do not love"
neg,"The epitome of processed pop music, Justin Bieber's ""Believe"" is an odd collection of ""songs."" Seven people ""collaborating"" on songs that have lyrics a 10-year-old could write that have absolutely no substance, and stale synthpop beats galore. If you want all of that and more, buy ""Believe."" You'll hate it."
neg,"I listened to this album with no preconception, but even the title doesn't sync with the songs, ""Believe"" is a name for more acoustic and relaxing albums, and this one it's fulled with electronic beats musics, i didn't get it, and he doesn't worked on the album, sorry, but, there is no work."
pos,"One of the most satisfying products ever, brimming with musical ideas and pure delight."
pos,"Taking a hint from Elvis Presley?s wide screen ambitions, Brian Epstein and The Beatles relentless quest to be the biggest recording artists in the world would mean a dual assault via film and accompanying soundtrack album. For those that couldn?t see the band live, and with the limited television exposure of the time, a movie seemed the perfect platform to expose the band to an audience clamoring for more than just vinyl records and photos. John Lennon?s astute request for Richard Lester to direct, gave the film the necessary feel good, light, comedy entertainment factor, and a perfect environment to mix dialogue scenes with the original music the band had created. Indeed, for the first time the songs in some ways feel more carefully crafted in order to be as relevant both visually and aurally. There would be no throwaway cover songs, heralding a new emphasis and a certain pressure to provide decent quality original material. It works of course, and considering Lennon and McCartney?s prolific self imposed song writing workload, there are still some shimmering pop classics amongst the 13 song set, that results in a long player that is marginally more consistent than their previous two.

As with earlier releases the dominant sound is their brash, upbeat, rock n? roll influenced pop interspersed with a few melodically sincere ballads. McCartney would provide his first classic love song with the Latin tinged ?And I Love Her?, and Lennon appears unusually wistful on the gentle ?If I Fell?. However, it?s the up tempo rockers that really stand out. Lennon?s clanging opening chord and Ringo?s hammering cowbell on the title track showcase a fuller instrumental sound than ever, thanks largely to Abbey Road?s new four track recorder. The fast paced, electrifying start is perfectly complemented by the breathless confidence of Lennon?s ?I Should Have Known Better?. With an unstoppably memorable melody, it remains one of Lennon?s best true pop songs. Other highlights include the striking, mildly aggressive ?Can?t Buy Me Love?, and the beautifully harmonic closer ?I?ll Be Back?. The misfires are rarer than any preceding recording, with only the messy falsetto line on ?Tell Me Why? blotting what is a superb compilation of songs.

?A Hard Day?s Night? is another joyous celebration of adept invention and frothy exuberance. Almost every song is a genuine winner and a potential hit. With this kind of momentum how could the world not notice?"
pos,"Whoever decided to let the Beatles record an album without any covers is a good dude. Each song is a great pop tune in its own right. This feels like the culmination of the Beatles' early career. Even more than the singles that made them a phenomenon, this feels like pop rock at its finest. To me, this album is the evidence that the Beatles were artistically driven. An album of this caliber would have been good enough for so many lesser groups. The Beatles wanted more. If they stopped here the Beatles would still be remembered as a great group, but rock and music in general would not have been the same. 

As to why this is the premier pop rock album, it covers so much ground without changing the style from song to song. There are upbeat love songs, soft ballads, and everything in between. Everything is well paced to feel diverse without any whiplash. Yet there isn't much actual stylistic diversity. The biggest change is when they use cowbell on a couple of songs. None of this would matter if the songwriting wasn't good. The group had matured quickly, and as such, the songs are great. "
pos,"An early rock and roll gem...a Beatles album to dance...this is why the Beatles were the absolute sensation in 1964.This album (and movie) represents an era...the British Invasion...and this is the most exciting,original and genuine of all."
pos,"Ooooo that rich sophisticated Beatles sound is finally here. This is where they truly showcase their playful, harmonious, rock melodies."
neg,I have heard people praising this album and it is utterly pathetic not worth listening to and I also heard people saying he worked really hard on the album when he doesn't play any instruments means to me there isn't too much to it. Please avoid this album.
neg,A super basic disc. Only talking about sex and girls. And his attitude leaves a lot to be desired. DESPAIR
neg,"Before today, there were 115 Chris Brown songs. I know this because I counted them?album tracks only, from all eight of his previous studio projects including Fan of a Fan: The Album, his hilarious-in-concept collaboration with the increasingly peripheral Kardashian satellite Tyga. Now, literally overnight, there are 160 Chris Brown songs?a 30-precent increase?thanks to the release of his 45-track Heartbreak on a Full Moon.

Were Brown a more compelling artist?like Prince, whose 1996 triple-album Emancipation was two CDs too long and still had nine songs fewer than Heartbreak on a Full Moon?we?d probably call this monolith an act of ill-advised ambition. But because Brown is a gifted enough singer, unburdened by a point of view beyond R&B radio conventions and seemingly incapable of giving voice to anything besides his toxic masculinity, this album can only really be read as hubris, an inability to edit, or simply poor impulse control.
The songs on Heartbreak on a Full Moon are neither amateurishly produced nor unlistenable. Many, in fact, have plenty of hooks, and only a few of which are borrowed directly from other artists. But these songs are also largely unmemorable, blending together into a two-and-a-half-hour murk of mechanical beats and plaintive, occasionally AutoTuned vocals. This isn?t OutKast?s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, or even Nelly?s Sweatsuit, with different moods for each disc; it?s just one unbelievably long and same-y slog.
A few tracks do break out of the monotony, for better or worse. There?s the now-de-rigeur gentrified dancehall cut, ?Rock Your Body,? complete with Drake-style faux-patois. There?s the equally obligatory trap influence on second single ?Party,? with an effortlessly charismatic Gucci Mane verse that, if nothing else, provides a few seconds of blessed relief from Brown?s nasally croon. The high notes on ?Nowhere? and ?Covered in You,? meanwhile, are a reminder that even Brown?s voice is capable of sublime beauty on occasion. For the most part, however, Heartbreak on a Full Moon fails to offer anything new from Brown, or contemporary R&B in general: It?s almost four dozen songs about fucking or breaking up, sometimes both in the same song.
Of course, any discussion of Chris Brown in 2017 must take into account what we might euphemistically call his troubled history with women, a reputation that?s not improved by his lyrics, which continue to depict women as targets for either his sexual prowess or his righteous scorn?or, again, both at the same time. To make matters worse, the Mtume-sampling Jheri-curl funk of ?Juicy Booty? is further marred by the presence of R. Kelly, another R&B star who never let an accusation of abuse get in the way of producing a good sex jam. Those who refuse to support Brown for these reasons can at least rest assured that they aren?t missing anything here; and for those of us who are just gluttons for punishment, well, Heartbreak on a Full Moon offers us a feast. This one, though, might be one indulgence too far."
neg,"Massive disappointment. If your a genuine fan of ""Weezy F Baby"" (ie you knew of him before MTV told you to like him) then you should find this album a slap in the face. After the wait from The Carter 2 I expected something with a bit of substance, but what I got was Wayne selling out and trying to win out the 50 Cent crowd with trash like ""lollipop"". The only track that reminds me of anything that makes Wayne good is ""A Millie"" but that is decidedly average and not a scratch on ""Money on my mind"". What disapoints me most is that Waynes mixtapes leading up to this completely transcend the quality contained in this album. ""Pray to the Lord"" ""I feel Like Dying"" and the Moby remix ""1000 Degrees"" are vastly superior to drivel like ""Mrs Officer"" and ""La La"". Everything about the album is a departure from the LW of old. No Mannie, no Baby, no production from the runners and no collabos with the collective that he has been spittin bars for these past few years (Rick Ross, Joe Crack etc) Im not surprised there are high critical reviews. Most of these pompous idiots didnt know who Wayne was six months ago so subsequently dont know what they are missing out on. A typical passage to pop territory guarantees Birdman Jr the positive reviews in the 'hip' publications and an entry point into the playlists of many morons' ipods. But for the real fans Wayne has made a mediocre record, and I hope the Drought 4 rectifies this drop in quality."
neg,This album is straight garbage and Lil Wayne is overrated trash.
neg,This shit sucks monkey ass
neg,"Mediocre... nothing new here, listen to it at least twice, then send it straight to the recycle bin."
neg,This by far a good album. With mediocre beats and stupid analogies. Whoever thinks Lil Wayne is the best rapper alive needs to listen to the track on this album feat. Jay-Z and listen to Jay-Z murder him.
pos,"In 1964, the Beatles were still the mop-topped Fab Four caught up in Beatlemania at the height of its fury. As a result of their overwhelming celebrity, that ""A Hard Day's Night"" showed a remarkable leap ahead in maturity of songwriting probably went unnoticed at the time. But in hindsight, the references to musical influences outside of the standard rock, pop, and soul fare which had informed their prior albums, and the fact that all songs are Lennon and McCartney originals hinted at the new directions to come for the band. Beyond all that, the album, particularly the first side, is jam-packed with songs that are now classics, with only a couple of throw-away fillers present. As good as the movie itself was, it will never eclipse the timelessness of the music that gave it a reason for being. With ""A Hard Day's Night,"" the Beatles had crafted the very best rock & roll album yet released by 1964."
pos,"Their songwriting is growing by leaps and bounds, and their sound is improving almost as fast. This album (if you get the British version, that is), is the first to contain 100% Lenin/Trotsky toons. And boy, after having a bit of 'cover lag' with Please and Wit' Da, I, for one, am ready for it. Thank God and Whoever Else that allowed this to happen, because these songs, naive as they still are, are fantastic almost to the extreme. From the 12-string (a first!) weird chording of the title rocker (one of my all-time favorites), or the acoustic harmony balladeering of 'If I Fell' to the juuuuust slightly Latin-tinged acoustic ballad 'And I Love Her' to the desperate John rocker 'Anytime At All' Hard Day's is a perfect sampling of what made the early Beatles so grand. Even the worse tracks aren't that bad. Take the George-sung 'I'm Happy Just To Dance With You'...the melody is just slightly inferior to the monsters, and the sentiment is a bit too naive to buy, but it's still melodic and still interesting. The beat helps, and that sinister strumming does too. And all the songs have something along those lines...a 12-string flourish, a great singing job by John or Paul, or something that makes it smell just like magic. And even 'When I Get Home' hints at having lots of actual sex rather than, you know, hand jobs and stuff. And it ends on a perfect note with the Everly Brothers-style folk-rock ballad 'I'll Be Back'...I tell you...without thinking too hard they made a classic. In 1964 I get the impression that a lot of this stuff was just effortless for John and Paul to do...they make it look easier than stealing Social Security from a gramma. And the songs are nice and compact, too, lots of 'em under 2 minutes even. And not because they'd become boring at 4 minutes, but because they had twice as many cool melodies to put down on tape than the usual perfect rock album. And 4 times as many as most decent rock albums. Oh, maybe its a bit too positive and smile-plastered (that was part of the charm, so I hear). But then Beatles For Sale is too depressing, so let's agree it comes out equal in the end. With the Beatles it always does."
pos,"A major improvement, thanks to more careful and sophisticated recording methods, and more thoughtful songwriting - this was the only Beatles record that consisted entirely of Lennon-McCartney tunes. Suddenly, the pathetically syrupy pop-song covers are gone, largely replaced by memorable, tightly crafted masterpieces (title track; ""I Should Have Known Better""; Paul's melodramatic ""And I Love Her""; the thrilling ""Can't Buy Me Love""). Even the toss-off ""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You,"" handed over to George to provide him with a lead vocal, is graced with brilliant backup vocals. The second side, thrown together at the last moment to fill out the record, does drag a bit (""When I Get Home,"" drab outside of its soaring refrain) - but it includes the wonderful rocker ""Any Time At All"" and two memorable ballads (Paul's ""Thing We Said Today"" and John's ""I'll Be Back,"" both with clever ascending hooks)."
pos,"A Hard Day's Night is the first truly great Beatles album. By taking the standard pop formula as far as it could go they paved the way for their future more adventurous, artistic triumphs. For sheer entertainment the album is difficult to beat, packing more hooks than can be found in most rock artists' careers into a mere half hour runtime. The album can be said to be the foundation for all that followed, and the fact that the band produced material far superior to the content of A Hard Day's Night is a testament to the extent of their genius."
pos,"""A Hard Day's Night"" was both a soundtrack to the dazzling Richard Lester-directed film and a triumphant album unto itself. It was the first album to contain only music written by John Lennon and Paul Mccartney as well as the band's first foray into four-track recording. ""A Hard Day's Night"" offers up a multitude of different sounds (bongos, harmonica, double-tracked vocals, cowbells) included on vibrant tracks such as the title tune and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" as well as thoughtful melodies like ""I Should Have Known Better."" ""A Hard Day's Night"" is full of youthful optimism, but The Beatles show a remarkable maturity in their songwriting and arranging on tracks like ""If I Fell"" and ""And I Love Her."""
pos,"After two great studio albums PLEASE PLEASE ME and WITH THE BEATLES, they released their third album full of own material. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT includes hits such as the title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" but also other classics. This was even better than their two first albums. Maybe because there was no cover songs or maybe their feeling was even better than before. I don't know, this just sounds perfect. ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" is one of my favorite tracks from the album, and it is sad that people don't know this album better. Sure number 1 hits include two classic songs from this album but hey, these all songs are my number ones."
pos,"Gear! ""A Hard Day's Night"" shows the Beatles at their absolute peak as a working band, and it is probably the best LP they ever cut. The song writing is as consistently strong as on any of their future releases (if not more so); the melodies are unforgettable; the harmonic invention is about as 'innovative' as any good pop/ rock band needs to get; and the whole experience is kept afloat by a serious sense of fun that at no point is in danger of becoming bogged down with overrated notions of 'growth' or 'mature experimentalism'. John, Paul, George and Ringo are in full bloom on ""A Hard Day's Night"", and it's all a long way off from the over-ripe indulgences of later releases. Whenever I read critics or fans opining about the Beatles' 'improved sound', or 'creative breakthroughs', it makes me wonder if there exists a slight unconscious snobbery for good, honest rock albums like this one, no matter how highly regarded they are. Still, for all this sort of high-handed critical nonsense the Beatles have only got themselves to blame. Top notch."

neg,"Absolute garbage. Lil wayne is not close to the top 100 rappers living. I would like to see him battle against nas. Has no talent whatsoever as evident by his lyrics. Yeah, the lollipop beat is good but the lyrics are shit and it ruins the song."
pos,"The only thing wrong with this album is that it tends to get lost behind the brilliance and growth exhibited by all the Beatles albums that followed it. On its own merits, it is flawless and really does capture the Beatles while they were still at the top of their game as performers (which people tend to forget that while they show continued growth as composers on each subsequent album, this was their peak as a real ""live"" band)."
pos,"A Hard Day's Night has better production and more unusual chording than the first two Beatles albums, despite the occasional popping-up of their old formulaic blues-rock style."
pos,"Considering that Help! functions as the Beatles' fifth album and as the soundtrack to their second film -- while filming, they continued to release non-LP singles on a regular basis -- it's not entirely surprising that it still has some of the weariness of Beatles for Sale. Again, they pad the album with covers, but the Bakersfield bounce of ""Act Naturally"" adds new flavor (along with an ideal showcase for Ringo's amiable vocals) and ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" gives John an opportunity to flex his rock & roll muscle. George is writing again and if his two contributions don't touch Lennon and McCartney's originals, they hold their own against much of their British pop peers. Since Lennon wrote a third more songs than McCartney, it's easy to forgive a pair of minor numbers (""It's Only Love,"" ""Tell Me What You See""), especially since they're overshadowed by four great songs. His Dylan infatuation holds strong, particularly on the plaintive ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and the title track, where the brash arrangement disguises Lennon's desperation. Driven by an indelible 12-string guitar, ""Ticket to Ride"" is another masterpiece and ""You're Going to Lose That Girl"" is the kind of song McCartney effortlessly tosses off -- which he does with the jaunty ""The Night Before"" and ""Another Girl,"" two very fine tunes that simply update his melodic signature. He did much better with ""I've Just Seen a Face,"" an irresistible folk-rock gem, and ""Yesterday,"" a simple, beautiful ballad whose arrangement -- an acoustic guitar supported by a string quartet -- and composition suggested much more sophisticated and adventurous musical territory, which the group immediately began exploring with Rubber Soul."
pos,"Help! sounds like a band in transition, shifting slightly uncomfortably from the pop thrills of Beatlemania to something more mature.
The title track is another raw, Lennon confessional, although its dark tone is partly disguised by the sheer energy of the performance. The songs are starting to be both their lifestyles and inner lives: women, affairs, the paranoia of fame. Lennon?s private disquiet is even more apparent on his folky, Bob Dylan-influenced You?ve Got to Hide Your Love Away. This was a departure for the Beatles, with its driven acoustics, whiplash chorus and even a flute solo.
Their sonic range is expanding as they start to get comfortable in the studio, Harrison riding a volume pedal on his pleading I Need You and in the drone of riffing, proto-heavy-rock song Ticket to Ride driven by Ringo?s heavy tom tom beat. And then there?s McCartney?s timeless ballad of regret, Yesterday, tenderly framed by acoustic guitar and string quartet.
Help! may not be their greatest album, but it contains some of their greatest early songs.

"
pos,"The fifth studio album by The Beatles, HELP!, was a huge improvement to their sound. They started to make also nice, sophisticated songs, such as ""Yesterday"" and ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"". Still, there was nice, upbeat pop/rock songs, such as the title track, ""I've Just Seen a Face"" and ""Ticket to Ride"". The album was a transfer album in such a way. Their next album were to be Classics With capital C. No wonder, there was three songs on their ""1"" album from this one."
pos,"I take issue with Allmusic's biography of The Beatles. There's a part where it essentially says ""critics regard Help! and Beatles for Sale as their two weakest albums."" I understand Beatles for Sale, but you put Help! in that same category? Really? I've looked up many upon many ranking of Beatles albums and while people tend to not rank Help! at the top I can't recall one that put Help! in the bottom two. Most I've seen often put either With the Beatles or Please Please Me below it. And that's not my opinion, I'm basing that on the rankings I've read online. But besides that point, in my opinion, this album is absolutely fantastic and probably their most underrated album.

Now I'll admit, after the first time I heard this I walked away thinking it was a weaker version of their classic movie tie in LP ""A Hard Day's Night"" but upon repeated listens I keep finding more and more to love. While I would still say A Hard Day's Night is the better album, I find there is much more to talk about on Help! Most people regard Rubber Soul as their first semi-jump as artists before going full on into Revolver, but you can see the tinier steps work their way into the Beatles repertoire in Help! and that makes the album all the more interesting.

The opening track is one of the Beatles masterpieces and really shows that while both writers were excellent, John matured his writing at a faster rate than Paul. ""Help!"" has great harmonies (it's really cool how the background vocals aren't on a simple time measure with the lead vocals, almost like an pre-echo of John) and this marks the first time the Beatles (John) wrote a song that was not about love. Paul follows it up with a very Beatlemania-esque song, although the implication of sex makes it a little more interesting, before John follows with another coup doing his best Bob Dylan impersonation on ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"". Then there's another John masterpiece with ""Ticket to Ride"" which has a really sick guitar riff to open the song.

Paul writes two standout tracks along with the rest of his Beatle-mania material, the folk rock ""I've Just Seen a Face"" and the constant contender for favourite Beatles song ""Yesterday"". The latter is interesting because its the Beatles first use of instruments that couldn't be played by the band themselves, with George Martin's choice to add a string quartet that Paul was initially opposed to, but upon hearing it loved it. This kind of experimenting is what would push the Beatles in their studio era. The only drawbacks are the two inessential covers, which could have been replaced with heart-breaker ""Yes it Is"" to make a much better album.

There's a lot of Beatle-mania material here, even George adds two entries as good as most of Paul and John's material, but the highlights I've talked about show how this album is much more than ""A Hard Day's Night 2.0."""
pos,"Help! is a lot like Beatles For Sale, featuring strong and passionate songwriting but the thing that separates those two records is that there is better music on Help! as well as more concrete statements in the lyrics. John writes some of his best songs in the title track, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, and Ticket To Ride, while Paul adds the sly The Night Before and Another Girl, but it's Yesterday where McCartney becomes a major force in the songwriting department. George Harrison's songs don't match either Lennon or McCartney, but he's improving. Ringo is outstanding on Act Naturally. This is where the band begins its shift into more serious territory. Key tracks are the title track, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, You're Going To Lose That Girl, Ticket To Ride, I've Just Seen A Face, and Yesterday."
pos,"Although this album is the soundtrack to their second feature movie, thematically it finds the Beatles starting to branch out and subtly venture into new musical territory. Bob Dylan's influence is stronger here, notably on John Lennon's ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and the title track. Sonically, ""Ticket to Ride"" was one of the heaviest rock songs ever released at the time, and Paul McCartney delivers the pop standard ""Yesterday"" as a solo piece backed by a string ensemble although the song is credited to the band.

The last cover tunes the group would release until Let It Be are here; the Larry Williams vocal-chord-shredder ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" and a country-western ditty ""Act Naturally"" sung by Ringo in one of his better vocal performances. And George has songs for the first time since the second album; ""I Need You"" and ""You Like Me Too Much"" aren't quite up to Beatles standards but do hold their own as great deep cuts and on a par with anything else anyone was writing at the time.

In spite of the advances made on this album, it really depicts the group mainly marking time until the next trip to the studio where they wouldn't have the pressure to put out ""product."" Indeed, this album would be the last true ""Beatlemania"" album before they would start to use the studio to explore and experiment with their sound."
pos,"Help! Wow & sigh. As my favorite number one group of all-time, picking this as my favorite lp of theirs, edging out ""Sgt. Pepper"" , ""Abbey Road"" & heck all the rest of theirs is saying something. From the effervescent movie, which for me is the long player video for the music, the UK lp of ""Help"" is perfection. Although I do enjoy the 5 instrumentals on the US ""Help"", here on the UK lp, you get all 7 Help songs in one grand sweep with no interruptions. And then Side 2, not as ""5 star "" as side one, you get a ""cobble-ation"" of solid Beatle songs most notably the perrenial ""Yesterday"", Ringo's fun ""Act Naturally"" & the US ""Rubber Soul"" 's glorious opener ""I've Just Seen a Face"", but that's another story. It's the perfect Side 1 that makes this 5 stars & for me the full fruition of the early half of the Beatle sound."
pos,"While the album's flaws prevent it from being in the same class as their later works and it lacks the consistency and pop perfection of A Hard Day's Night it's nonetheless a high quality outing, with highlights that are an indication of the musical brilliance to come. Even the material that can be comparatively called filler still is hardly bereft of merit, and some clever hooks can certainly be found there as well. The group makes some strong advances on Help!, be it the songwriting growth evidenced on songs like the title track or the excising of prominent stumbling blocks like the dreaded six cover formula, and the resulting product is a very good album that transcends its flaws and delivers a memorable, entertaining experience to the listener."
pos,"This review of review is the second part of a thread based on my musical history based on my Album 100 list you can find in my profile with the first album being 12 Gold Bars by Status Quo.

Maybe to each one's surprise I was already a rock lover for two years but hadn't actually consciously heard of the Beatles until I saw the film ""Help!"" at school around my 13/14 years and I was immediately sold! This movie was the start of an absolute love story with the title song and the whole album. Also this was the first and only LP I ever bought. After that I turned immediately to taping cassettes and exchanging them with friends (the first music ripping ;)

Although ""Help!"" comes early in their carreer after their great but not fantastic earlier albums like ""A Hard Day's Night"", I think it really stands out. Apart from ""Help!"" itself I really liked and like their countryish songs like ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"", but of course the pre-hard rock song ""Helter Skelter"" was also fantastic and ""Yesterday"" the absolute opposite of that.

The Beatles are still one of my favorite bands and ""Help!""still my favorite Beatles albums even with close contest from Abbey Road and Revolver. 

Although I'm a really big fan of the Rolling Stones, they can't compete with the Beatles and I'm sorry to say I didn't even include a Stones album in the list although different ones would appear for example in my top500.

Also albums from projects after the Beatles of the Beatles' member don't appear in the rest of the to 100 although I'm a big fan of George Harrison, John Lennon, the Wings, etc as well."
pos,"The group's second foray into feature films produced exceptional new music on this soundtrack album. ""Help!"", which includes ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,"" ""Ticket to Ride,"" ""Yesterday,"" mingles tracks featured in the film with groundbreaking original songs. With the release of this album, The Beatles brought a wide array of instrumentation (woodwinds, electric piano, tambourine) and orchestration to a pop album. The immediacy of their songwriting, their jangling riffs, and their charismatic vocals helped to usher in the sound of the '60s."
pos,"Help! is not a major change for the Beatles, but it is a return to form on more of the distinctiveness that made ""Please Please Me"" and ""A Hard Day's Night"" memorable, sporting better production and a few expansive musical ideas."
neg,"To start off, he doesn't actually rap once during this piece of sh*t album. He talks slowly and auto-tunes his voice so he doesn't sound like a retarded monkey, even though he ends up sounding like one. He should kill his dumbass manager who lets him continue making this music and then kill himself, that way nobody has to hear any of his new music."
neg,"Ugh. disgustingly overrated. he's sounds brain dead and the beats are all either similar, annoying, or uninspired. plus horrible lyricism. really find it hard to believe that this garbage album appeared in so many top ten lists. what's next?"
neg,"I wanted to know what the hype was about Lil' wayne and I was disappointed that so many people listen to this garbage. Songs like ""lollipop"" and ""mrs. officer"" have great beats, but the lyrics bring the whole song down. What has the world come to to call songs about oral sex great music? I have no clear idea why critics managed to give this album a higher score than Lupe's Cool."
pos,"""Help!"" has been underrated almost as much as ""Rubber Soul"" has been overrated. Perhaps that's because the Beatles don't look anywhere near as cool on the cover, or because this album is a tie-in with the Fab's second movie of the same name.

The Night Before, I Need You, Another Girl, You're Going To Lose That Girl, and I've Just Seen A Face might be lesser highlights by comparison, but they are all inventively arranged and fizzle with a youthful pop effervescence which helps belie any weariness the Beatles might have been feeling at the time (creatively or otherwise). Act Naturally is a cover version of a Buck Owens classic and is a far better fit for Ringo's musical personality than What Goes On is. It's Only Love has been dismissed by John Lennon (who wrote it) as second-rate, but he's comfortable adding a layer of gentle sarcasm to his vocal delivery, which helps point up a more relaxed and down to earth, less self-consciously artistic vibe than on the more 'mature' (read: earnest) ""Rubber Soul"". The dividing line between the Beatles' pop and experimental eras is drawn here.

Best song: HELP!

Unless we are dealing with the American issue of this record, its A-side is supposed to reflect the actual soundtrack to the movie, while the B-side contains seven independent songs - technically repeating the formula of A Hard Day's Night (while the American release trustily repeated the formula of its own Hard Day's Night by stuffing the LP's other side with disposable instrumentals). But already the actual music is light years away from the level of 1964. By August '65, when the British LP came out, the competition was hot, and now that Bob Dylan had shown the way to making pop music count as real art, it was no longer just about retaining the top position on the charts; it was just as much, or even more about pushing the boundaries.


Of course, he who wishes to still write off Help! as ""early, immature Beatles"" is fully within his right to do so. After all, it's the soundtrack to their most ""immature"" movie ever, isn't it? But this sure don't answer the question of how in the blazes did they manage to become ""late and mature"" over all of the exactly four long months that separate this album from Rubber Soul. Thus, let him who wishes to stay in question land stay there forever. I prefer to dwell in a land of answers."
pos,"Like almost everything that the Beatles did from this record on, it's not merely good, but groundbreaking. The harmonies are superb (""Tell Me What You See""), the hits are unforgettable (title track; ""Ticket To Ride""), John's lyrics are advancing rapidly (""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away""; ""It's Only Love""), and Paul contributes a frighteningly modern-sounding semi-acoustic number (""I've Just Seen A Face"") and a startling, wildly successful experiment dispensing with the normal four-piece rock band backing track in favor of a string quartet (the widely imitated and covered ""Yesterday"").

Again, a great step for the Beatles overall, but you still have the usual early Beatles sound most of the time."
pos,"The Beatle's ""Help!"" Is possibly the last album they did before they went on to become auteurs of the rock genre. Side One Consists of Seven Songs of the soundtrack to the vastly inferior spirtitual successor flick Help! Even though the movie is not that great as most people remember it, the songs pop out. I've Just Seen A Face (Heard as the opener to the superior U.S Release of Rubber Soul) is one of the band's greatest achievements. I would say this is one of their top 15 songs of their discography. Yesterday, the most covered song in the history of music, is one of The Beatles' best on this album, I might only be talking about songs from Side 2, but Side 1 has some great hits too.

You're Going To Lose That Girl and ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"" are the two songs that I think held the movie together, especially Hide Your Love as it is one of the most memorable tunes John ever sang.in my opinion. All the songs are great, but not amazing like on their next masterpiece Rubber Soul (I have the U.S Version of Rubber Soul) but hey, It has some great hits, some memorable riffs like the finisher of Dizzy Miss Lizzy and the album is solid for everything it is, even if it's just half soundtrack half studio album.

pos,"I hate to be a party-pooper, but this is the only Beatles album that leaves me feeling almost completely underwhelmed. It doesn't suck, per se (and it's better than PPM, but given that the band had moved out of even being capable of writing slop like Ask Me Why, that's pretty much a given), but ... well, there are a couple of major problems I have here. First, it sounds to me that while they've started taking drugs, they haven't been taking them long enough for them to fire up the old creative processes, you know? Instead of hearing some of the world's greatest songwriting minds on overdrive, like in the next few releases, it just sounds like they're bogged down. They are trying to experiment a bit, but it's mostly falling flat, which brings me to my next point. I honestly believe that by this time, the group had taken the genre of early 60's pop as far as it was going to go, and it wouldn't be until the next album when they would start bringing in as many outside influences as possible. Add in the fact that in some places it seems like they're starting to recycle old material and ideas (You're Going to Lose That Girl, regardless of the cool harmonies, is little more than an inferior rewrite of It Won't Be Long, while the lyrics of It's Only Love belong on Please, except that if written back then they would've rejected them) and the guys were coming dangerously close to self-parody. In other words, if ever the greatest pop group in the history of man could have been accused of stagnation, of all things, this was it.

So there you are. For most groups, this would probably be their masterpiece. For the Beatles, it's one of the weakest albums of their career. Feel free to get it, but don't invest too much time in it. Besides, the true glory days were about to begin "
pos,"The only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews, there are few other rock records as controversial as Let It Be. First off, several facts need to be explained: although released in May 1970, this was not their final album, but largely recorded in early 1969, way before Abbey Road. Phil Spectorwas enlisted in early 1970 to do some post-production work, but did not work with the band as a unit, as George Martin and Glyn Johns had on the sessions themselves; Spector's work was limited to mixing and some overdubs. And, although his use of strings has generated much criticism, by and large he left the original performances to stand as is: only ""The Long and Winding Road"" and (to a lesser degree) ""Across the Universe"" and ""I Me Mine"" get the wall-of-sound layers of strings and female choruses. Although most of the album, then, has a live-in-the-studio feel, the main problem was that the material wasn't uniformly strong, and that the Beatles themselves were in fairly lousy moods due to inter-group tension. All that said, the album is on the whole underrated, even discounting the fact that a sub-standard Beatles record is better than almost any other group's best work. McCartney in particular offers several gems: the gospelish ""Let It Be,"" which has some of his best lyrics; ""Get Back,"" one of his hardest rockers; and the melodic ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ruined by Spector's heavy-handed overdubs (the superior string-less, choir-less version was finally released on Anthology Vol. 3). The folky ""Two of Us,"" with John and Paul harmonizing together, was also a highlight. Most of the rest of the material, by contrast, was going through the motions to some degree, although there are some good moments of straight hard rock in ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""Dig a Pony."" As flawed and bumpy as it is, it's an album well worth having, as when the Beatles were in top form here, they were as good as ever."
pos,"Whereas Abbey Road came together somewhat naturally?in a proper studio, with longtime producer George Martin at the helm?Let It Be (and its accompanying film) was completely forced. Its uncharacteristic spottiness has much to do with the wrongheaded approach.
From the beginning, Let It Be was Paul McCartney?s baby. He?d been leading the band since manager Brian Epstein?s death in 1967, and as relationships grew strained, and the greatest rock ?n? roll band of all time started to splinter, Paul seemed the least willing to, you know, let it be.
Somehow, he convinced John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr that the best way forward was to hire a film crew and make a movie about the band?s efforts to rehearse for a live performance (or series of live performances) that would help wipe away the acrimony and make everything fab once again. As any reality-TV alum can attest, the presence of cameras rarely makes life easier, and it didn?t help that a completely checked-out John insisted on bringing then-girlfriend Yoko Ono to the sessions.
Not that she was the problem. Harrison was the first to snap, and he quit the band about a week into the sessions. He agreed to return, but only if they moved from the Twickenham soundstage where they?d been working to the basement studio at their own Apple Corps headquarters in London. It was there that the group hunkered down for the remainder of the month, amassing hours and hours of music Lennon described in a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone as ?the shittiest load of badly recorded shit?and with a lousy feeling to it.?
That line is part of a longer quote wherein Lennon defends Phil Spector, who came on to mix the album after the group twice rejected versions put together by engineer Glyn Johns. Known for his bombastic ?Wall of Sound? aesthetic, Spector tarted up several of the tracks with orchestral overdubs, and while Lennon was pleased with the results, Paul was incensed.
McCartney was particularly cheesed off about Spector?s cheesed-up ?The Long and Winding Road,? a tune Paul would radically strip down for 2003?s Let It Be? Naked, a revisionist-history lesson that involved tearing down the Wall of Sound and presenting the songs as he felt they should be heard.
However fans feel about Spector?s contributions, he?s not the villain of this story. No one is. Let It Be is the sound of four grown men with shared histories and diverging futures trying to squeeze blood from stones. The album contains a few moments of brilliance (?Two of Us,? the title track, the freewheeling country-rock finale ?Get Back?) amid silly jams and a trio of wonderfully ragged performances recorded on January 30, 1969, when the Beatles took to the roof of Apple HQ and gave their final live show.
To be certain, Abbey Road is the neater Beatle conclusion?it even ends with ?The End.? But if the saga must wrap with Let It Be, the record is a reminder that no one is infallible, you can?t force inspiration, and nothing lasts forever. Also: The Beatles at their worst were still pretty great.
Read on for our track-by-track take of this endearing fiasco?a record that might be deemed a five-star classic were it made by anyone other than John, Paul, George, and Ringo.
?Two of Us?: Supposedly a love song from Paul to his soon-to-be-wife Linda, this jaunty acoustic tale of two crazy raincoat-clad drifters careening through life on someone else?s dime almost certainly references McCartney?s relationship with Lennon. Reality creeps in with that line about how they?re ?chasing paper? and ?getting nowhere,? but ever-plucky Paul puts on a brave face, singing with that trademark Macca warmth and ending with the spoken-word assertion, ?We?re going home?you better believe it. Goodbye.?
?Dig a Pony?: Pulled from the rooftop show, ?Dig a Pony? is Lennon in Bob Dylan mode, rattling off semi-sensical phrases over a soulful blues-rock backing anchored by his own scratchy rhythm guitar, some mournful lead work from Harrison, and a lowdown Paul-and-Ringo groove. It?s Lennon?s only genuine contribution to the project, and as a tossed-off trifle he?d later dismiss, it?s a reminder that he and the boys could still make something from nothing?even amid chilly atmospheric conditions and chillier interpersonal vibes.

?Across the Universe?: Lennon?s other key Let It Be track was born in 1968 and originally issued on a World Wildlife Foundation charity album. Here, it gets the full Spector treatment, and low and behold, the lush orchestration give John?s ponderous words the stateliness and sophistication you want from a song about tumbling through the cosmos in search of the meaning of life. It?s among the most beautiful things Lennon ever did.
?I Me Mine?: Tracked in April 1970 with everyone but Lennon present, ?I Me Mine? famously stands as the last new Beatles song recorded before the group?s split. Funny that it?s a Harrison tune?and a corker at that, an attack on egotism that turns from doomy 6/8 orch-pop ballad to scorching ?50s-style rocker. In keeping with the spirit of the lyrics, Harrison shares the spotlight with Paul, who?s an absolute demon on keyboards.
?Dig It?: Originally a much longer song, this 51-second studio vamp finds Lennon spitting Dylan wordplay in Mick Jagger fashion over a keyboard-heavy groove. It?s a nice bit of levity before Paul gets all serious on the subsequent title track.
?Let It Be?: As with ?Yesterday,? Paul owes this, the final Beatles single released while the group was still together, to a dream. It featured his late mother, Mary, and it inspired him to write this enduring piano ballad about taking life as it comes. The album version is even better, as Spector amps up the orchestration and swaps in an alternate Harrison guitar solo?one that?s meaner, more assertive, and more in line with the assuredness of Paul?s vocal.
?Maggie Mae?: Even shorter than ?Dig It,? this shaggy tear through an old Liverpool folk song about a prostitute and a sailor again lightens the mood. The Beatles got away being funny in ways other rock bands simply couldn?t, and it?s great to hear them clowning like schoolmates, even if those days were long gone.
?I?ve Got a Feeling?: The second of three tunes taken from the rooftop gig, ?I?ve Got a Feeling? is a melding of two seemingly incongruous numbers: a sunny McCartney love song that gives the tune its title and ?Everybody Had a Hard Year,? written by John after he?d divorced his first wife, discovered hard drugs, and been busted for weed possession alongside Yoko, who later suffered a miscarriage. As with the Sgt. Pepper?s tune ?Getting Better,? the combo of their glass-half-full and glass-half-empty sensibilities makes for a richer song, and Paul?s exuberant blues-rock hollering contrasts nicely with John?s staid, cynical cataloging of what everybody?s been up to.

?One After 909?: Written by John as a teenager and first recorded by the Beatles in 1963, this old-school chugger proves a highlight of the rooftop concert, as John and Paul forget they?re bearded rivals at the close of the ?60s and let loose like a couple of mop-tops or greasy ?50s rocker cats. The performance shows up on the album, and even without the accompanying footage, the tune crackles like nothing else on the album. Props to Harrison for peeling off one of his coolest solos since ?I Saw Her Standing There.?
?The Long and Winding Road?: Maybe Paul had a point. Spector?s orchestration gives this weepy ballad?Paul?s response to the band?s unraveling?a glitzy jumpsuit-Elvis feel. That said, Spector had a crummy rhythm track to work with, and with its super-earnest, almost schmaltzy lyrics, the song wears its strings like the King rocked sequins?which is to say pretty well. The public must have agreed: ?The Long and Winding Road? reached No. 1 and gave the Beatles their 20th and final chart-topping American single.
?For You Blues?: ?Same old 12-bar blues,? Harrison jokes, and sure enough, that?s what this song is: a standard-issue bluesy romp memorable mostly for John?s slide guitar, Paul?s creative piano playing (there?s paper stuck between the strings), and George?s own self-effacing commentary. ?Elmore James got nothing on this, baby,? he says with a laugh, as if to admit that whatever he and the boys are up to, it ain?t authentic blues.
?Get Back?: Whether JoJo and Loretta are code for John and Yoko or just a couple of wayward characters Paul made up, the album?s would-be title track is a crisp, easy-does-?er country-rock nugget featuring nimble picking from Harrison, some funky vamping from guest keyboardist (and all-around tension alleviator) Billy Preston, and nasally McCartney vocals not unlike those Dylan would use on his soon-to-be-recorded twang-out Nashville Skyline. ?Get Back? was originally a send-up of England?s pervasive anti-immigration sentiments, and in its apolitical finished version, it retains enough humor to suggest Paul knows he and the gang can never truly go home.

pos,"Let It Be has always seemed to be the only Beatles album (not counting Yellow Submarine) that I have heard people criticize. To me though, this is some of their best material. It would probably rank as my 5th favorite album by them too. The reason why would be that it has a great mix of all of their different styles such as there more Rock & Roll oriented side in ""One After 909"" or their more solid Rock oriented songs such as ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""Get Back"". Harrison's ""I Me Mine"" is a great song about how the band was falling apart with fighting between Lennon and McCartney and is also one of the best songs on the album. Let It Be is a great swan song for the greatest group in the 20th century and shows us just how they stayed solid to the very end."

pos,"Organic, gritty, and with a blues/gospel tone, Let It Be is a great send-off for albums by The Beatles, featuring great cuts like ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""Get Back,"" but never forsaking gorgeous tunes like ""Let It Be"" and ""The Long and Winding Road."""
pos,"In between the final recording sessions for this album, and the time it finally appeared in record stores, was about 16 months of squabbling, mixing, remixing, breaking up, rejoining, creating one more album (Abbey Road), then breaking up again for good. Such a sad fate for an album that's been over-criticized.

This album was intended as a back-to-basics approach as suggested by Paul McCartney. Originally conceived as a project to eventually start playing live again and rediscovering its bar band roots, the Beatles couldn't recreate its old magic and the sessions soon dissolved into acrimony. After nearly an entire month of bickering, the band was able to record enough material to mix an album for either an intended TV performance or feature film, culminating in the now-famous live performance on the Apple Building roof, the last time they played together in public. But attempts at mixing the album yielded unsatisfactory results, and the tapes were shelved.

After two attempts to mix and produce the album, Phil Spector was finally brought in to see what he could do with it. His contributions have long been the subject of debate and controversy, but he was able to produce an album most the band thought was worthwhile enough to release. And indeed, by the time of its release, Paul McCartney had abdicated from the band in a press release for his own solo album. By and large, Spector would leave the performances true to the ""back to basics"" approach, but his wall-of-sound treatment of ""The Long and Winding Road"" has been the subject of much discussion and controversy over the years. To a lesser extent, he also adds strings to ""Across the Universe"" and ""I Me Mine"".

Let It Be, like most of the later period albums, was McCartney's baby. He wrote and sang the bulk of the material, with John Lennon mostly withdrawing creatively from the proceedings. McCartney's contributions consisted of the three hits from the album, ""The Long and Winding Road"", ""Get Back"" and the title track, with ""Two of Us"" as an intended Everly Brothers-like duet, and actually collaborates with Lennon by combining one of his songs with one of Lennon's to form ""I've Got a Feeling"". Lennon's contributions weren't of the highest quality, as he was likely looking forward to collaborations with Yoko Ono and possibly his own solo career at that point. Still, he brings the lovely ""Across the Universe"" to the table, and it's one of the album's highlights.

The sessions of Let It Be may have been the most grueling ever, and may have served as a catalyst for the band's eventual breakup, but once they got down to it and simply played, they were still as good a band as they ever were."
pos,"There's no doubt about it, this is a creative set of tracks infused with that instantaneously recognizable post-Sgt. Pepper's Beatles sound. To be honest, as a whole album, it is not quite as strong as the previous string of masterpieces from the Fab Four that emerged as lavish opuses filled with songs that were incredibly original and wholly inventive.

That previous claim may border a bit on hyperbole, but there is a definite disjunction between a project like Abbey Road that hits the listener with quiet grandiosity and Let it Be, which feels more like a breezy assortment of musical ideas that are often quite enticing.

That's not a slight on this album. In fact, the contrast adds a dimension to Let it Be that distinguishes it in the Beatles oeuvre. There's a charming lackadaisical feel to the listening experience that's accentuated by the handful of comical asides and by the elegant simplicity of the rock tracks that seem to proudly eschew creative pretension in favor of a more rootsy feel.

While there are some weaker tracks, the individual talents of the three main songwriters, George, Paul, and John shine brightly through the diverse contributions they provide. There is definitely something for all Beatles fans, ranging from the contemplative ""Across the Universe,"" to the off-kilter groove of ""Dig a Pony,"" to the anthemic sincerity of ""Let it Be."" This album sounds like the work of indisputable masters of their craft kicking back, jamming out, and exploring new ideas together for one final time."
neg,"Most of Graffiti that is, the songs that do not detail what ex-girlfriend Rihanna and the rest of the world have done to him -- is a natural progression for Chris Brown. Like many young cred-seeking male singers who have just exited their teenage years, Brown clumsily emphasizes womanizing and hedonism and balances it out with a couple clean and empty ballads. Out of this portion of the album, only a couple songs leave a lasting impression, and when they do, the silly things that come out of Brown?s mouth tend to be the reason; take ?As stingy as you are, I think you ready,? part of ?Take My Time??s chorus and hopefully no woman?s idea of an effective bedroom line. A two-track patch of gloopy and gawky Euro-pop, where he?s on slightly better behavior, is at least more tolerable than the inane chest-puffing, but nothing comes close to the big singles from Brown?s first two releases. The rest of this album could not have been voiced by anyone but a brat who pleaded guilty to the felonious assault of his pop star girlfriend, one who considers himself a victim. On ?Famous Girl,? sonically sprightly but otherwise acidic and full of contradictions, Brown cries foul at being cheated upon by his ?heartless? ex but taunts ?I might have cheated in the beginning.? He accuses her of being a heartbreaker and then boasts ?I?ve broken my share of hearts.? Another jab, ?I was wrong for writing ?Disturbia,'? makes it plain that the song is about Rihanna. Both ?Falling Down? and the sarcastically titled ?Lucky Me? could lead a onetime sympathizer to fantasize about pulling a Chris Brown on Chris Brown. In these songs, Brown is exceptionally insufferable, conveying that his unimaginable wealth and social privileges are no consolation for being put through the ringer. ?Even though I?m so damaged, I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd? is capped with ?You don?t even know how hard it is, do you?? He also lets his listeners know that he has had to do photo shoots when he has not felt like smiling, and that he has ?given up everything in exchange for being alone.? Maybe his supporters should be considerate and assist in putting the young man out of his misery. If they stop purchasing his recordings, concert tickets, and merchandise, the evil entertainment industry, all media outlets, and predatorial heartbreakers will lose interest and loosen their grip on him."
neg,Pretty boring.Some Tracks were great but most of the album is just boring
neg,"The cover of the new Rihanna album features a severe black-and-white head shot of the star. She has her hand clapped over her right eye; her left eye, surrounded by a raccoon ring of mascara, glares back at the viewer. The context here is no secret: It is impossible to look at those eyes without remembering the images of Rihanna's bruised face in the aftermath of her beating in February by ex-boyfriend Chris Brown. Until recently, the singer has been quiet about the incident. Songs like ""Russian Roulette"" ? a domestic-violence victim's confession whipped into soaring melodrama ? tell us why: She was busy saying her piece in the studio.
If by some accident of fate, or maybe record-company cynicism, the new Chris Brown album has arrived at the same moment as his ex's. The results tempt a reviewer to talk in terms of moral victories, but the real triumph here is artistic. Chris Brown has made a bland, occasionally obnoxious, pro forma R&B album. Rihanna has transformed her sound and made one of the best pop records of the year.
Brown mostly ignores the elephant in the room, churning out punchy dance-pop songs full of club-ready beats and Casanova gestures. He gloats about ""the cars and the girls and the cribs."" He promises ecstasy (""Gonna make you bloom like a flower,"" he tells the girl in ""Take My Time""). There are also lost-love ballads, delivered by Brown in his nasal wisp of a singing voice. But as unfair as it sounds, the Rihanna incident has made it impossible to hear him in the same way; the sweetness that animated songs like 2008's ""Forever"" is now a hard sell.
With Rihanna, singing has never been in doubt. The question has always been personality: Is there a flesh-and-blood woman lurking beneath the big voice and model looks? On Rated R, she answers the question emphatically. There are a couple of engaging uptempo tunes. (The StarGate-produced ""Rude Boy"" is smutty fun, with a Caribbean bounce.) But this is an album with a grim theme: love gone horribly wrong. ""What you did to me was a crime,"" Rihanna sings in the slow-boiling ""Cold Case Love."" Elsewhere, she is bent on vengeance. ""I lick the gun when I'm done,"" she cries in ""G4L,"" ""because I know that revenge is sweet."" The songs are etched in somber shades and minor chords, with Rihanna belting over synths and booming beats. The results are a musical match for the black-on-black CD cover ? goth R&B.
No single song approaches the grandeur of Rihanna's 2007 megahit, ""Umbrella."" But even the most sprawling power ballads here have an intimate quality. In the plaintive ""Stupid in Love,"" Rihanna turns the blame inward. ""My new nickname is 'You Idiot' ?/That's what my friends are calling me when they see me yelling into my phone."" Such introspection is evidently beyond Brown. On ""Lucky Me,"" he turns his troubles into an occasion for self-congratulation: ""Even when my world's falling down/I still wear a smile."" A simple sorry might have made a better song ? or at least made Brown a better guy.

neg,"Musically, Graffiti is a fairly ingratiating affair: The production is clean and often lively, and Brown sings well enough. The problem is what he?s singing."

So poetic.One of his great's and that is saying something. Paul McCartney's ""Let It Be"" is a wonderful gospel song. It is rightly seen as one of his best.One of the greatest songs ever. The opening piano is one of the great introductions. Like wise ""The Long and Winding Road"" by McCartney is a great ballad. ""Get Back"" a great rocker by Macca and a huge hit. George's ""I Me Mine"" is a great song. I love ""I've Got A Feeling"" and that great example of the genesis of the Lennon- McCartney song writing partnership, ""The One After 909 "".I also love ""Dig A Pony"" by John Lennon Even at their nadir as a working group in terms of their relationships, they still produced music for the ages. Graham Paterson."
pos,"Unfortunately, they lost interest in it halfway through. But that's the only flaw.

Best song: LET IT BE

The rating is a bit lower than for most of the previous 'mature-period' albums. But that's only because of the fact that this is a very raw album. The sessions actually took place in the beginning of 1969, before the Abbey Road sessions, and culminated in the famous concert on the roof; however, due to total dissension of the members lusting for each other's blood the results were shelved and resuscitated only a year later - by Phil 'wall-of-sound' Spector. Therefore, it is not really a Beatles product - it lacks the traditional McCartney/George Martin production and has a lot of 'alien' embellishments, like Phil's orchestration of 'The Long And Winding Road' that pissed off McCartney (I don't know what are their current relations with Phil) and still pisses off fans, although nowadays they can finally be relieved by picking up a copy of Anthology-III that restores the original version. Still, in all other senses it is the Beatles.

The host here, once again, is Paul, with most of the really important songs belonging to him. However, he wouldn't remain in this position for much longer - for reasons you all know. And, in all, the album has a very interesting feel: never mind all the Spector embellishments, it still sounds as raw as a piece of freshly bought meat (pardon me for the bloody reference). All the fade-ins and fade-outs, bits of dialogue in the studio and on the roof, false starts ('Dig A Pony'), guitar tunings ('Get Back') - this was the closest to a 'Beatles-at-work' album before all these Anthologies started pouring out. For a person who's addicted to the well-polished sound of nearly all existent Beatles recordings, this can be a serious blow - but I assure you that it's very easy to get used to."
pos,"If nothing else, 'Let It Be' does capture an essence of where the Beatles were at in early '69: McCartney desperately striving to keep this juggernaut going with three of the finest compositions he ever created, surrounded by three blokes who, though obviously extremely talented and still doing a professional enough job on the final takes, don't really want to be there anymore (though things would briefly brighten for 'Abbey Road' in the summer). Whether or not Spector 'improved' the somewhat-finished article will always be open to lively Beatlemaniac debate, Paul hated every wall of sound that got built onto his tracks whereas Lennon, Harrison and Starr seemed to swear by him, to the point where he produced virtually their entire solo output during the early '70s. Again, maybe that's another hint as to where the greatest studio band in history were in their dying days: Paul vs. the rest and vice versa. But yes, as per the original review it may indeed be their worst album of the post-Rubber-Soul-breakthrough era, but 98% of bands would kill to have it as their greatest ever work."
pos,"Okay okay, I do get why people didn't like Phil's production. After all, the purpose of this album was to be much like a veteran version of Please Please Me, hence the cover of the original LP title ""Get Back"". Roots rock, very simple, an album that can be played live with relative ease, and Phil's lush production contrasts heavily with this approach. But then what did you expect Phil to do? He has a particular style that has been acclaimed, why wouldn't he apply that here as well? And while fans could speculate before, now with Let it Be...Naked finally released we got to see how the album looked without Phil, and it was...basically the same. The track listing was shuffled, Paul's long complaint with ""The Long and Winding Road"" finally got resolved (to conflicting opinions as far as I can tell), but other than that and ""Across the Universe"" there isn't much different here. Despite Phil being a fan of lush production he does show restraint for most of the album (other than Long and Winding Road, and to lesser extents I Me Mine and Across the Universe) 

By this point John is the least involved of his career, as he only has two solo songs to contribute. John rambles on ""I Dig a Pony"" which is a decent rocker but exactly what John called it, a ""nonsense"" song. He does add the standout ""Across the Universe"" which I'll admit is slightly better Naked than here, but both are still fantastic.

Paul's definitely the best here. ""Get Back"" is a good rocker, a great statement of intention and should have been the opening track. ""The Long and Winding Road"" I often waiver about whether I prefer Spector's version or not, but either way it's over the top good or subtly tender. My favourite is the obvious album highlight ""Let it Be"" where the Spector version is MUCH better, the guitar solo sounds awful in the Naked version, and a song as schmaltzy as Let it Be should steer into its grandiosity. 

George has two songs and it's hit and miss. No one seems to regard ""I Me Mine"" all that highly but it's one of my favourites, George's delivery along with the strong guitar and organ do it for me. Then on the other side of the spectrum is ""For You Blue"" which is probably my candidate for worst Beatles song ever.

John and Paul collaborate a couple of times too and that's always good to hear. The weak link is ""One After 909"" which only has value based on the novelty of the post Beatle-mania Fab doing a a 1963 song. The Fab Four were too good to be doing those tunes anymore. Opening ""Two of Us"" is a sweet folksy tune, supposedly about Paul and his wife but everyone of course concludes it about John and Paul. And the highlight is ""I Got a Feeling"" which has good interplay between the two. It also has the weird John line ""Everybody had a wet dream."" But hey, who cares, it sounds great.

I prefer Spectors mainly for the dialogue and skits giving the album the impromptu feel good concept that Naked lacked. Whichever you like more, they're both great albums."
pos,"Let It Be isn?t a bad album, it could be great but the production and meandering between songs takes away from its quality. Phil Spectors embellishments on songs like ?The Long And Winding Road? and ?I Me Mine? bog down the sound and feel forced. He also chose to put the two throwaways ?Dig It? and ?Maggie Mae? on the album. It still had great songs like the title track and ?Across The Universe?, which stand as some of The Beatles? best songs. However, I believe that the ?Naked? version of this album is truly great, removing the ?Wall of Sound? embellishments, removing the talking between songs, and replacing the two previously mentioned throwaways with ?Don?t Let Me Down?. Because of this, I consider the ?Naked? version to Ben much superior. Still, the original album is fine on its own and is still worth buying if you?re a Beatles fan."

neg,A totally stupid cd - your IQ may be at risk if you listen to this more than once.

neg,"I knew this album was gonna be disappointing. But I had no idea that this is how was gonna turn out. I don't mind comebacks. But he tries to say he's sorry, it got corny. I could have just soap operas instead. It's a 1 album, that descends into a 0 rating, but jumps bad into a 1 because it's so disappointing."

neg,"Only hardcore fans will fall for this fake, generic ""whirlwind of emotion"". All you'll see are poorly produced, poorly written, and highly repetitive songs. The whole album is a pathetic excuse of music. Seriously, only diehard fans can dilude themselves into appreciating this ""album"" for more than what it is."
pos,"If this album is ''lousy'' as Rolling Stone Magazine says...well, give me 12.000 ''lousy'' albums like this for my collection?"
pos,"Even if it does often have a thrown together feel at times, that doesn't stop this from being a very quality rock album that The Beatles, in terms of rock albums as a whole, are synonymous for near perfecting, and this album, despite the minor flaws, is definitely no exception."
pos,"Never mind the snarky reviews, Let it Be justifiably stands alongside the Beatles core albums as an essential and transcendent work. Does it lack the pure perfection of Rubber Soul or Revolver? Yes, of course. Does it have a few songs below the usual standard? Yes, but then again so do Sgt. Pepper and The White album and it doesn?t detract from their greatness. Is it a little rough around the edges? Yes, but that?s part of it?s charm, and some production flaws don?t keep it from being a classic. Both Let it Be and Long and Winding Road have become pop standards and while there are those that will sneer at Long and Winding Road, calling it schmaltzy and saccharin, which it is, it is also majestic, melodically powerful and a true pop classic. Plenty of songwriters try to write songs like this and fail, and if you think it?s so easy to write a song like this, then you do it.. Let it Be is mostly Paul?s show as he also comes up with one of his best rockers Get Back and (along with John) 4 folksy/roots rockin? tunes in Two of Us; One after 909; I?ve got a Feeling and I Dig a Pony. It?s reminiscent of Rubber Soul the way they combine folk with pop except these songs sound more like real folk than pop. They took some getting used to but being taken from the can in their raw form and not re recorded with a slick pop sheen gives them an earthy charm . 
John?s single true pure pop contribution is Across the Universe, which is shamefully ignored by the dismissive Allmusic review, and IMHO, it?s one of his best songs, combining a subtly powerful melody and mystically dreamy lyric. Pure genius there and makes one wish John had been a little more involved in the album. 
George chips in with the dramatic I Me Mine (a commentary on the fragmentary state of band and almost kind of a poor man?s Let it Be) and For You Blue, which is a bit of a throwaway but a Beatles throwaway could be the best track on lesser artists albums, it?s another example of the Beatles pop brilliance molding a blues pattern into a catchy and sweet ditty that is memorable and fun, George even turns in a cool blues guitar solo doing his best Elmore James impersonation. Not up to the standard of his Abbey Road material but still very good. 
Spector has been criticized for his heavy handed production and to a degree I agree but when you write songs like Let it Be, Long and Winding Road or even Across the Universe you?re just begging for big over the top production work. If you don?t like it we now have the Naked lp, which strips away the production and allows you to hear the songs in their raw form.

All that being said, I?d rate Let It Be at the bottom of the Beatles core album but hey, this is still the Beatles and an essential piece of rock history. ."
neg,"Besides the two singles out now, I cannot remember any other songs on this album. Exclusive was excellent, this was a huge disappointment to a former big fan."

neg,"I'm sorry but this album isn't great. It's ok though. But compared to his last album, this isn't his greatest."
neg,"Another atempt to be ''cool'' and ''hip'' and ''popular'' and thats all this album gets him. It says nothing about his maturity as a man or an artist, the videos are like-wise very bland and the same ol same ol we've seen over and over and over and over. Take a guess about what his lyrics are about SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX!! If you havent bought this album then God bless your ears!"
pos,"As the Good Ship Lollypop began to experience some trouble against the Gumdrop Icebergs, Paul McCartney, no doubt feeling he was the most capable and hardworking member of the group, began to take serious control of the group conceptually. First it was Sgt. Pepper's, which Paul seemed to nearly will into being, then it was the MMT film project, and lastly it was this one. It was Paul's idea for the group to 'get back' to their roots and record an album live in the studio with little or no overdubbing, like in the ol' days before they went and got all complicated. Just a perfect for a bunch of guys who really couldn't stand each other (couldn't stand Paul and/or Yoko, that is) by the time of the 1969 recording sessions. Imagine YOU being in a room with a megalomaniac songwriter who keeps dictating to everyone what to play and sing, and being forced to do take after take after take because it was his idea to do this all together now. Pbblt.

The film (which I, again, have sadly never seen, being more inclined in my youth to watch The Song Remains The Same a 400th time instead) apparently shows many more signs of stress than the resulting album does. As it stands, Let It Be (the record) sounds genial, friendly, and full of good humor. It also does complete its mission to sound more 'lifelike', possessing a real nice rough edge on a lot of the tracks. But that doesn't mean the songwriting isn't top quality! It is! The songs are just less slickly arranged and complex than the stuff we've come to expect from the Blattles, especially after something as obviously 'put together' as Abbey Road was. I happen to like both approaches, and both of them have their place at my dinner table.

Songwise, John is happy to be writing more 'song-y' songs than he was on either TWA or AR, contributing one of his best reflective ballads since 'In My Life' and 'Julia' with the outstanding and ultra-melodic 'Across The Universe', also one of my favorite songs ever by the guy. He also brings us 'One After 909', the first song he ever wrote (when he was like 14 or something) and a nice Berry-ish basic rock song. For his others, 'Dig A Pony' is quite complex for a John mid-tempo rocker, and 'Dig It' is but a short rap. Still, it's nice tho to hear the guy give us things other than the 'fuck you's' he wrote for Abbey Road, White Album, and the later singles (think 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)' and 'Yer Blues' for examples of the less cuddly John). George is a tad less genius as he has been recently, giving us only 'I Me Mine', a cool basic rock tune with lyrics that must've been quite indicative of the recording atmosphere, and the toss-off boogie 'For You Blue', snappy but lightweight. Maybe if this album were more 'of a piece' this thing would fit in as a great album filler track, but right now it's just a filler track. John and Paul's jolly camaraderie on 'Two Of Us' almost sounds like they still care a lot for each other, and have you checked out those lyrics?"
pos,"The sheer quality of the material transcends any production issues, resulting in yet another excellent album from the band. It may not be quite up to the standards of records like the white album and Abbey Road, but it's still a masterpiece in its own right, a highly charming, enjoyable listen that differentiates itself from its predecessors with a unique raw atmosphere that's wholly unlike the usual immaculately produced Beatles fare we're accustomed to."
pos,"Love this album , w great material and a wonderful , echoey, mysterious atmosphere . Too bad Phil Spectre was hired by John Lennon, who foolishly added a ""new"" guitar solo on Let It Be , and added lush orchestration to Long and Winding Road, a song McCartney envisioned as a minimalist, philosophical piece. I do like however what Spectre did with Across The Universe!"
pos,"A cloud hangs over Let It Be. In spite of the turmoil that would in time cause their inevitable demise however, there are moments of strength among the wreckage. The mood of the album is desperate and some of the music plays like a jam session that should've been stopped in its tracks. But there are moments where they remember they're still the Beatles and we remember why we loved them to begin with. The Phil Spector production is a hit and miss with me, it enhances some songs and takes away from others. Key tracks are Two Of Us, Across The Universe, its title track, I've Got A Feeling, The Long And Winding Road, and Get Back. Hearing John at the end say he hoped the band passed the audition, I think it's safe to say that they did time and time again."
pos,"Let It Be is far superior to Abbey Road to my ears, or really anything since Help!, because it sounds like a rock and roll band. Not perfect, but that makes it even better. I know the boys weren't getting along, but I bet it felt good to just plug in and let it rip. I wish they'd done more records like this."

Really, what is the appeal of this album?"

He has no talent whatsoever. 
Seriously people if you think this is music or that this guy is anything more than a hip-hop hack, you're delusional."

neg,"The singles are pretty acceptable but I still wonder about all the hype concerning the other tracks. Completely outrageous, terrible... The matter is not West's ego or his attention-seeking behaviour with his lyrics (alas, which are not even a bit intelligent like almost every critic praise)...not even about his wannabe-indie attitude... it's about his music, which is so avant-garde (??...well, yeah, according to some people) that my ears can barely listen to it. Lyrics: full of cliches, inconsistent, derogatory... It's a real mess and quite clearly the most over-rated thing of the year and maybe of the decade."
neg,"I used to love Kanye's music, but this album is awful. Some of the language he uses is just downright rude and I believe Kanye should be ashamed of himself. He has lost himself a fan after this album. It was despicable. What appals me even more is the positive reviews it has got from various esteemed critics"
neg,"I was very disappointed in this album. I read from reviews that it was a good album so I bought it. well after listening to it a few times, I can safely say that the money I spent for it was wasted. There really is not that much entertainment value in this album and I'm a huge fan of music as well as rap. Mr. West's ego is just too much. Nobody should have an ego as large as his, not even people with the greatest contributions to the world (i.e. great scientists like Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, etc. Those men have changed the world in so many good ways, and even from them I would not understand having this large of an ego). What have been Mr. West's accomplishments? Well he has put out a few albums. And while many may have liked them, they surely have not changed anything for the better. All this album is is some average rhymes/lines with him bragging about how great and what a ""genius"" he is. and while, granted, that's what most rap is, Mr. West takes it to an unnecessary level. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO SOME WHINY RAPPER TALK ABOUT HOW GOOD HE IS."
neg,"Ouch, my ears! Since when did stealing others' music and shouting at people qualify as creating? This is just another example of meglomania unchecked, a man surrounded by yes-men, the critics falling into that category as a whole. Give me some great Wyclef any day over this."

neg,"All hype and no substance. 

That basically sums up what I think of this album and of the artist. Kanye West is a rapper who can't rap (can't even enunciate properly), a songwriter who doesn't write songs (""sampling"" and using a stable of credited writers), a producer who uses auto tune to fix his garbage. "
pos,"LET IT BE had been ready before ABBEY ROAD but it was released afterwards. After such great albums, it was a disappointment. There's beautiful songs, such as the title track and ""The Long And Winding Road"" and great rocking tracks ""I Me Mine"" and ""Get Back"". Still, most of the songs are average and it even sounds that The Beatles was tired. The Beatles is one of the favorite bands of mine but this was their lowest work."
pos,"There are four good songs on this, the final release by the Beatles, which really highlights their limitations as musicians and songwriters. Following their departure from bubble gum pop, they have relied heavily on the production techniques of George Martin, but on Let It Be they have returned to a more conventional ensemble and are shown up. In the main they are playing straight ahead rock blues and they just aren't particularly good at it, also Phil Spector's over polished production really doesn't suit most of the music, ""Across The Universe,"" Lennon's best contribution to the album, maybe being the exception. ""Let It Be"" is an enduring anthem with a simple yet powerful structure, but the production almost ruins it, ""Get Back"" is a great pop rocker, and ""The Long And Winding Road"" is a fabulous Ray Charlesesque hymn, but again this is over produced. I also don't mind Harrison's ""For You Blue"", but who is he kidding when he says Elmore James got nothing on this baby? If anything it just shows what a rudimentary musician John Lennon was...and who ever told Lennon he was funny?"
pos,"The U.S. version of the soundtrack for the Beatles' ill-fated British television special embellished the six songs that were found on the British Magical Mystery Tour double EP with five other cuts from their 1967 singles. The psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of Sgt. Pepper's, and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of ""I Am the Walrus""). Unlike Sgt. Pepper's, there's no vague overall conceptual/thematic unity to the material, which has made Magical Mystery Tour suffer slightly in comparison. Still, the music is mostly great, and ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" and ""Hello Goodbye"" were all huge, glorious, and innovative singles. The ballad ""The Fool on the Hill,"" though only a part of the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack, is also one of the most popular Beatles tunes from the era."
pos,"They lost the plot with their dopey TV film, but 1967 was still their zenith as songwriters. For once, the U.S. release went better than the British original. In place of two vinyl EPs came a whole album filled with classic singles ? including ?All You Need Is Love? and ?Penny Lane? ? from the period. The result was simply the best set of Beatles tunes so far on a single disc.

"
pos,"Great debut album. Gets a little repetitious by the end, but it is an overall enjoyable listen."
neg,"I got this album thinking hey it might be good. Power was a pretty good song, but then I heard the album. All the beats besides Power sound like they were produced by some crappy amateur which I know Kanye isn't after hearing some of his other beats. The singing get's annoying most of the time, and I wish he would stop. How many rap songs have to rap about porn stars, and all the other typical rap stuff. A couple of the songs are okay, but then you read the lyrics and then you give up on Kanye completely. You can try and read these lyrics off this paper before I lay them, but you can't take the sting out these words before I say them.

This isn't Kanye's case, because besides the beats there's nothing new, and it's the same **** At least in Eminem's case he changes it up a little. In Jay-Z's case he at least does it with a cool style. Overall some of the beats are okay, but Kanye doesn't execute it correctly and it's the same lyrical **** as before and he hasn't matured at all since his first two releases (the ones I can actually listen to). He tries to be original but he fails. I give this album a 1/10 for me, but for some people's taste in music a 3/10. I hope that Eminem or Andre 3000 come out with some new material soon. Rap needs it."
neg,"In a world where celebrities hide from the paparazzi and disguise their ""pop"" lifestyles in order to relate with their fans, Kanye West is really doing the opposite: His beautiful dark twisted fantasy about marrying a pornstar and divorcing her by the end of the night (Hell of a Life) doesn't really seem like a fantasy because for West it could very well happen - yet he manages to create a vibe that says otherwise, because his feelings as a sexual/normal individual (his Id) are always stronger than his boastfull self that knows of fame and fortune. That is what makes My Beautiful Dark Twisted...""Fan""tasty"": Kanye West is able to portray his life as a public superstar figure honestly whilst still being a character that everybody can relate to. This is a skill Mr. West has had since the time he sang ""wait til i get my money right"" on Can't Tell Me Nothing although he already had enough of it: He walked in the shoes of a fan that might not, although he didn't step out of his own because wanting more money is a feeling that goes beyond numbers. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a sonic collage of juxtapositions that aren't really juxtaposed because they interact with each other so well: West has the gift of making genre-less music that still holds some level of credibility in all of the genres it stems from: Having said that, this album (like most Kanye West albums with the exception of 808s & Heartbreak) is no less a hip hop album, in fact it's really as close if not closer to oldschool hiphop as it is to pop and rock. Not buying it? go listen to the hard hitting drums on Dark Fantasy which is a quarter of the album title. Twisted Fantasy is more hiphop than The College Dropout, yet it's so much more: The samples reach you in a way that rap usually can't even dream of, which is a surprise in that he uses samples that are quite unknown as opposed to the grandiose songs he would use on previous works (e.g. Diamonds are Forever - Shirley Bassey ). West's musical repertoire has definetly gotten bigger since then and now consists of much more than just adding drums and a baseline on his Akai Mpc 2000, although he at that exact time proved this by having score composer and multi instrumentalist Jon Brion co-produce the entire Late Registration. Common for both, but much more so on this album are the details that are small yet so significant. From Nicki Minaj giving her english accent over Mozart's Lacrimosa to Bon Iver's ""at the mall there was a seance"" over semi-dramatic violins, this is an album filled with layers that leave goose bumps on woman that have been lasered"
neg,"This album was really nothing special. More of the same for Kanye, which sucks because I really thought he was one of the more revolutionary artists of our time. Oh well, at least he has some good old stuff."
neg,"It is simply appalling that this man continues to be so over credited for producing nothing but crap time and again. West must be the most over-rated ""artist"" the world has ever seen, thus his humongous ego being based on people who somehow find something good in one of the most talentless artists to ever record. ""Fantasy,"" just like everything else he has recorded, sounds exactly the same as, well, everything else he has recorded, and it's just refried crap on digital. The man has made a career out of seemingly releasing the same terrible album over and over...and I wish someone would explain to me how this appeals to people...but then again, the country he is most popular in also kept ""Macarena"" at #1 for weeks. Kanye should be flipping burgers in new Mexico and should just never be seen or heard from again. This is THE most over-rated album of 2010. Oh look! Not one song of his on the radio...what a shock... "
neg,"How this man managed to pull the wool over so many peoples' eyes is anyone's guess. From the awkwardly-sampled stolen beats and riffs to the stuttered, a-rhythmic ""rapping,"" this album is a mess. I recognize that rhyming is a bendable concept when it comes to popular music, but words do not rhyme with themselves and repeated phrases do not you Robert Frost make. 

West had trouble getting others to accept his rapping at first, and for good reason. I will admit that I am not a big fan of rap at all, but it has its place; Kanye doesn't seem to know that place. He passes off his jarring, conversational, I'm-trying-to-explain-philosophy-in-my-college-discussion-section-while-drunk voice as music and it just doesn't fly. Rap works when you're doing things with your voice not possible when singing. Kanye simply does things with his voice not pleasant either way. 

I can only hope that this overwhelming delusion the general public and so many reviewers seem to suffer from is a passing fad. I can only hope in 10 years we'll look back on this like many now do on Will Smith and say, ""We listened to what?"" I can only hope this isn't this generation's legacy."
neg,"This album feels hollow compared to his last releases. The music itself is uninteresting and has Kanye trying to reinvent himself yet again; however, unlike past releases, he failed at creating a solid album."
neg,"Whenever I hear a new Kanye song on the radio the first thing I think is, wow, this is some surprisingly bad rapping for the radio. Then I think, oh it's Kanye, that's why. His flow is really weak, his rhythm is flabby and his rhymes are boring but for some reason people really like him. Another thing that hits me is how overcrowded the beats and production are. I'm in awe of producers that can make a beat swing hard with only a few elements. Kanye's heavy layering of samples without regard to whether or not they're doing something exciting rhythmically has an amateurish sound to me. Finally, the samples themselves bug. I think that if you're going to sample, i.e. borrow someone else's idea, you've got to either make it better than the original or put it into a new context that gives it an entirely new identity. ""Stronger"" is a good example of his failure there. The song is really more a cover than a sample of the Daft Punk original because it's a direct lift of the chorus, but Daft Punk's version is much more thrilling and danceable. Kanye just made it worse. Kanye is obviously a great music listener because he draws samples from a very broad array of genres. But generally when I hear the original song the sample came from I think it was better off without him. Saying all that MBDTF is probably the best yet from Kanye. If I heard it as a mixtape from some unknown guy on the street I'd probably think, this guy's got something. If he keeps working at it, starts paring down that production, sharpens up his rhythm he might have something interesting. But this isn't some unknown amateur. It's Kanye West, king of the charts and supreme darling of the critics. I just don't get it."

pos,"Magical Mystery Tour is something of an oddity in the back catalogue of The Beatles, being a contender for their most underrated album. Now, I know what a lot of you are thinking when you read that sentence. ?How on earth can anything made by The Beatles ever be considered underrated"" They?re the biggest selling band in history!"" Normally, I?d consider agreeing with you. However, this album truly is underrated, and the reason for this is simple; the time in which it was released. Coming after the release of Sergeant Pepper?s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Revolver, but just before the release of The White Album, this album often gets lost in the history of The Beatles, meaning that it?s forgotten how extraordinary it is. Like The White Album, this is an album that sounds as if it simply has too many ideas on to all be by the same band, and in a way, that makes sense, because this album is effectively half film soundtrack, and half compilation some of the band?s biggest singles in the preceding year. The album itself is a typically diverse collection of songs, including psychedelica that would not have sounded out of place on the sprawling concept album that was Sergeant Pepper?s Lonely Hearts Club Band, as well as some great pop songs, such as Penny Lane. Something that is also worth remembering when listening to this album is the concept in which it was released. 1967 was the year of the famous ?summer of love"", meaning that songs like All You Need Is Love become revealed as genuine anthems of not only the time in which they were released, but of a whole musical era. Starting to see why this album can fairly be described as underrated yet""

Opening track Magical Mystery Tour immediately gives the album a very fun filled mood, with brass instruments providing a constant backing, along with rushes of noise that were meant to represent the full extent of the fun of the tour. The lyrics reflect this, with McCartney?s continued refrain of ?Roll up for the mystery tour"". Although it would be typical to cast this as just another drugged up psychedelic song, it goes beyond that, and provides a solid opener for the album, as it doubtless did for the doomed TV show of the same name. The Fool On The Hill is another McCartney composition that would later be referenced on The White Album, and is based around a very mellow piano part, featuring gorgeous, bittersweet recorder parts which lurk just under the other instruments on the song. The lyrical content seems to be a strike at the people against the prevalent hippy culture of the time, saying that the fool on the hill is wiser than people think, which reflects the then personal beliefs of the band. While the first two songs provide backing for people who say that this is the most underrated of Beatles albums, Flying undermines this somewhat, being one of the few lyricless songs they recorded. This song is being based around Lennon?s synthesised organ and mellotron parts, which create a much spaced out atmosphere, but which ultimately don?t leave a huge amount of substance to the song itself. Of course, it wouldn?t be a Beatles album without a Harrison composition on the album, and Blue Jay Way is the example this time, with it being far darker than most of the music contained here, thanks to a fuzzy sounding verse, where the vocals sound completely drained, while Starr?s drumming is surprisingly high in the mix, and the heavily repeated phrase of ?don?t be long"", which gives the song a narcoleptic air rather than any other sort of feel. Listening to it now you can still smell what The Beatles were probably smoking as they recorded this song, and that stands out on this slightly paranoid oddity on the album, even though it?s definitely a very fine song.

Your Mother Should Know is possibly the second weakest song here, with a strangely stately air that sounds as if the music was designed for an upbeat ballroom dance, although it does possess some of the little touches that made The Beatles stand out, such as a surprisingly catchy keyboard part, along with vocal layering that reflects how well the Lennon and McCartney duo complemented each other. While repetition of one phrase can work well though, here it merely grates slightly on the listener, giving the song a slightly stillborn air. However, one thing you could never accuse I Am The Walrus of is being stillborn. Regularly cited as one of the lyrically strangest songs ever recorded, talking about ?sitting on a cornflake"", singing penguins, and indeed the refrain of the title, it?s musically complex, with all sorts of indescribable effects going on under Lennon?s delirious vocals, as well as a break in the middle of the song where a string section effectively takes control of the music. If you wanted to listen to a psychedelic Beatles song, this is probably the one that would get recommended more often than any other, and with good reason. Although it?s complete nonsense, it?s also undeniably fantastic to listen to.

At this point the original soundtrack for the Magical Mystery Tour TV programme ends, with the subsequent five songs all being previously released singles. Naturally, this means the mood of the album changes completely, but it also gives the album something of an air of a greatest hits compilation. Hello Goodbye is the first song that fits into this category, encapsulating everything that made The Beatles such a great pop band. A hugely melodic piano line, along with Starr?s airy, syncopated drumming provides the backing for McCartney?s lyrics, which are sung in what could be described as a near-infuriatingly happy voice. However, in my opinion it?s the coda to the song that makes it, where, after the end of the music, the band comes back in with a breezy outro, while McCartney sings nonsense sounds, punctuated with the occasional whoop over the top. Strawberry Fields Forever is a contender for half of the greatest double A-side single in history (along with Penny Lane). It?s also structurally incredible, with two versions being recorded, before George Martin?s production wizardry in speeding one up and slowing the other down, therefore making one version, led to the hugely changing textures of the music, greatly assisted by what was becoming a trademark brass section and mellotron. The music is very hard to describe, although it contains many sections, very ambiguous lyrics, and a final moment where John Lennon allegedly says ?I buried Paul"" (actually ?cranberry sauce""), fuelling the Beatles rumour mill about the status of Paul McCartney?s life.
Penny Lane and Baby You?re A Rich Man are far less complex listens, although both are great pop songs, with Penny Lane being a jaunty run through Liverpool, in what reads like a descriptive tribute to the city. Again, the instruments sound excellent, in particular the trumpet interlude during the song, and this is another definitive example of The Beatles?s mastery of pop music. Baby You?re A Rich Man is comparatively conventional compared to the previous pop masterpieces, although its strangely shuffling drum rhythm, and the relatively intoned vocals during the chorus gives it a slightly jazzy feel, which again shows that although Magical Mystery Tour is thought of as a ?psychedelic"" album, there is far more to it than that inadequate description allows. The final track on the album, All You Need Is Love simultaneously combines being undeniably corny, with the lyrics ranking among Lennon?s most optimistically hopeful, with also being strangely beautiful. The irony of the track, with the intro coming from the national anthem of France, and the horn parts that add a whole new air to the song makes this among The Beatles?s very best songs, and the universal nature of its message at least partially explains why its fame has endured, even by the standards of The Beatles, to this day. The final moments of the song, where the music breaks down before a reprise of the band?s classic She Loves You comes in shows the true wonder of this band-in four years they had changed music so many times that those few lines sound as different compared to albums such as Revolver as something by Vera Lynn would do to us.

Although underrated is obviously a relative concept when it comes to The Beatles, this album can indeed be fairly described as such. Although the first half is more experimental, it contains moments that live up to the bands very best work, and would be pushing for inclusion on a single disc greatest hits album, and the second half, to all intents and purposes, would have a decent chance of being included in its entirety of that album. The occasional weak track on here prevents this getting an entirely perfect score, but if you are looking to get into the most important band of all time, or are trying to expand your collection, it?s inevitable that eventually this will appear on your list of albums that you need to hear. If for no other reason than for the fact that this CD contains their greatest psychedelic experiment along with the ultimate double sided single, this should appear near the top of that list.

pos,"This is the one worthy U.S. Capitol compilation which has since been elevated to the official Beatles lp canon. The Brits had these songs scattered across 3 singles & 2 eps. (imagine having to play through all of those to hear the album). Anyway, you have 11 great songs in one place & the 24 page color book is a really nice bonus."
pos,"Much like Help!, the Magical Mystery Tour is criminally underrated due to the huge shadow cast by its predecessor. This album comes across more as a Psychedelic Pop album as there is even less of a rock edge on this than Sgt. Pepper's, and it results in a fantastic album made in the same vein, deserving mention as one of the best Beatles albums of all time.

The original EP is a solid set of songs but not enough to make this work 'epic' territory, and as everyone knows it's Capitols mangling of their EP that makes it such a classic. The original EP is also evidence of one of the problems of post Revolver Beatles, Paul's dominance of album material. The original EP has six tracks, Paul singing lead or major harmony in three of them, with one instrumental, one John, and one George. But of course McCartney is fantastic so this isn't so bad. ""Fool on the Hill"" has some great flute and is a nice balance of psychedelia without going heavy on the instruments. I'm also an avid fan of ""Your Mother Should Know"" because it's so bouncy and infectious, it's also ingrained in me the whimsical final dance in the TV movie. Then of course John delivers with his only entry ""I Am the Walrus"" which just gets more fascinating each time you listen to it. The other three tracks are all good too, but not legendary by any means. Once again, I question why they didn't include George's ""It's All Too Much"" which is my favourite psychedelic track that George did, but at the very least it's better than ""Blue Jay Way"".

Then you get the second half, five Beatles singles thrown on by Capitol, and not only do they fit in perfectly but they elevate this set from good to classic. You get the double A-Side of ""Penny Lane"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" both cut during the Sgt. Pepper's sessions and are absolutely essential for any Beatles fan. As you would expect, Strawberry has more interesting lyrics and production, by Paul manages to make you fall in love with Penny Lane and you don't care how mindless it is (although of course the music itself is fascinating). There's also ""Hello, Goodbye"" another example of Paul creating pop perfection seemingly effortlessly, and the harmonies are absolutely wondrous. John closes things with ""All You Need is Love"" which is yet another classic Beatles track, there's nothing to say about it that hasn't already been said, it's perfect, happy, and a great send off for a great album.

The Beatles were falling apart at the seams and this movie was considered an atrocity, but you wouldn't know it through the music as they sound just as on point here as they've ever been, even Capitol couldn't make this album worse like they had so many others."
pos,"The difference between Sgt. Pepper's and this album is that Sgt. Pepper's attempted to be a single groundbreaking chunk of great songs and turned out to be a jumble, and this album attempted to be a jumble and turned out to be a single groundbreaking chunk of great songs. This album, and the movie of the same name (which I've never seen, bummer) were simply the Beatles having a bit of fun with their new freaky selves, and the heavy vibe of Sgt. Pepper's is lifted here, and thankfully so. What I get is that this is, front to back, packed with wonderful songs and not an annoying or dated or heavy-handed one in the bunch. And only one that's not a rock or pop tune! (Paul's requisite 30's pop tune 'Your Mother Should Know', which, surprises of surprises, sucks really bad. What is Paul's obsession with his parent's music?) But, you know what, all the other songs rule!

The first half of the album is the soundtrack to the film, originally available on EP (the first release of this record was as a double EP) and surely enough, begins with the theme song to the movie and the title track for the proceedings. It's a fine one, close to the title track of Sgt. Pepper's but more, you know, rocking. And Paul's vocals are great. Paul's other songs (besides 'Yo Mama') are just great, too. 'Fool On The Hill' is the best Paul ballad in awhile (maybe since 'Yesterday', but maybe not) and is melodic as hell. The second side is a collection of singles and and EP from 1967, and here Paul's 'Hello Goodbye' rocks normally, like it could've been on Help!. Plus the 'hello goodbye hello goodbye!!!' with the ascending line are just more of that genius Paul melody.

John, luckily, isn't nearly AWOL like he was on Pepper's, and contributes some of his best ever work to this record. After this he tended to cultivate his simpler song-writing, but here he's still writing those great weird psychedelic anthems. And a John anthem is a world anthem. 'I Am The Walrus', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane', 'Baby You're a Rich Man', and 'All You Need Is Love' are everything from semi-nutso chaos to sweet melodies to Paul-esque nostalgia to Between the Buttons-era Stones rocking to, well, his simple anthem writing.

Heck, I even love George's semi-weird 'Blue Jay Way', which kicks the Kix outta 'Within You Without You' PLUS it has a neat dark vibe that matches it's 'fog on LA' lyrical imagery. Of course, he's still far from the pop sense of Paul or John, but his stuff is the spice on the salad. Too much of it can be a drag, but in this dosage it's just perfect. And the instrumental 'Flying' is another highlight for me: catchy, dreamy, and smooooth...I love it. I wish it were longer.

Boy, I just can't find more than one bummer on here. The rest of it is just fantastic."
pos,"Whether or not Magical Mystery Tour is a proper studio album or just a soundtrack, it really is a great addition to the Beatles discography. It isn't Sgt. Pepper, but it doesn't need to be and it stands on its own merit. A bit spacier and a lot more free than its predecessor, Magical Mystery Tour as an album has the Beatles expanding their psychedelic vision and exploring the ideas they had developed throughout 1967. Key tracks are The Fool On The Hill, I Am The Walrus, Hello, Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Baby You're A Rich Man, and All You Need Is Love."
neg,"The acronym apparently stands for ""Forgiving All My Enemies"", a typically self-pitying claim on the moral high ground from someone who, lest we forget, was convicted of assaulting a woman.

Isn't forgiveness something Brown should be requesting, rather than bestowing? But that's the topsy-turvy mindset of US R&B for you, a world characterised, on this showing, by paranoia, reproach and bogus regret, along with the standard ""aspirational"" bragging about money and sex. F.A.M.E. is equal parts bubblebath boudoir soul and more bullish beat-driven floor-fillers, tricked out with familiar guests like Timbaland and Justin Bieber, the most lively of which is Busta Rhymes's babble-rap over the Clangers-style bleeps of ""Look at Me Now"". As regards originality, the use of a Michael Jackson sample on ""She Ain't You"" shows how hard Brown's trying."
neg,"They say those who refuse the past are doomed to repeat it, but Chris Brown?s past has proven consistently more fascinating than his music. Consequently, it?s no surprise that his domestic assault has always been the go-to topic for media outlets over the last couple of years, no matter how strenuously he tries to escape it. Still, has there been a less spontaneous display of ersatz realness in recent memory than Brown?s much-publicized window-busting, shirt-tearing tantrum backstage at Good Morning America this week, all too coincidentally on the very same day his new album F.A.M.E. dropped? And has there been an easier, crasser explanation from a recrudescently debased egomaniac than the tweet that immediately followed, in which Brown moaned about how Charlie Sheen has gotten a free pass for indulging in his own worst impulses (and is, in fact, arguably more popular than ever), while Brown can?t seem to sneeze or fart without once again being run ragged by the snarkers that be? If Brown previously only gave off the vague impression of being the type of person who believes himself to be an even bigger victim than the real victim, this week?s actions removed all doubt.

But even worse, is that what he?s going for? The unfortunate but inevitable nihilism one faces when considering the stardom of people like Brown forces one to also conclude that no PR move is accidental, and the fact that he name-dropped Sheen only reinforces my skepticism. So does the fact that GMA is not going to press charges, a move that got appropriately rebutted by a Videogum blogger with two salient points: ?WHY?? and ?FUCK YOU.? In response, I say a) because GMA benefits from this incident, and b) damned straight. For what it?s worth, one-time Slant contributor Rich Juzwiak doesn?t seem to think Brown is guilty of anything other than being a recurring fuck-up with questionable levels of self-awareness. Fair enough, because if Brown is wrapping up the bad-boy public persona he?s increasingly comfortable embodying, it?s not a posture he reflects in the album his PR campaign is meant to support.

Indeed, the title?s acronym is intended to either represent ?Forgiving All My Enemies? or ?Fans Are My Everything,? neither of which suggest the ?Fuck, Another Mess-up Exaggerated? tone he?s going for extracurricularly. Which is good for impressionable ears, but dull for discerning ones. Again, his album isn?t really much of anything other than a collection of avoidant club jams (the spin class-ready ?Yeah 3x?) and indirect overtures of love/lust (the passive-unaggressive ?Up 2 You? and ?She Ain?t You,? which matches carbon-copy sentiment by recycling SWV?s sample of Michael Jackson?s ?Human Nature?)."
neg,"F.A.M.E. is a vile, despicable album that doesn't deserve to be supported in any way, shape or form. Its very existence is a frightening indictment of our times, in terms of our attitudes to music, women and the cult of celebrity."
neg,"Graffiti may have housed the party hit ""Transform Ya"", but otherwise it was a massive trainwreck. Chris Brown was never going to be mistaken for a crooner, but the mismatch of sorrowful lyrics framing Brown as a victim with cold, soulless production just made for bad listening. Between his continued anger problems and his inability to pick decent material to sing, Brown's career seemed on an ever-downward current. But then a pair of funny things happened: first, Brown embraced his bad boy image. By covering his body in tattoos Lil' Wayne style and releasing a collaborative mixtape with Young Money's Tyga, Fan of a Fan, Brown reinvented himself as half-singer, half-rapper. In the process, he convinced a surprising amount of women that his sexiness trumped his attitude (as is the bad boy's wont) and with the surprise success of that mixtape's ""Deuces"" (which leads off F.A.M.E.), Brown began his public rehabilitation.

All of this surprise goodwill manifested itself in a tribute to Michael Jackson during which Brown appeared to tear up during his performance, and more than anyone save Usher (who has consistently served as Brown's career template) he appeared affected by Jackson's loss. With a hit single, the audience's sympathy, and graduation from his anger management classes, Chris Brown seemed to have done the unthinkable and rescued his career.

F.A.M.E. appears unaware of any of this, however, and takes advantage of nothing. Back are the impersonal beats that dominated Graffiti, back are Brown's apathetic vocals, and in place of all the whimpering over being ostracized are stupefyingly basic lyrics about sex, sex, and sex. R&B has always been about sex, granted, but in comparison to something like Trey Songz' ""Love Faces"" or ""Alone"", songs like ""Up 2 You"" and ""Next 2 You"" are childish and trite, while ""Wet the Bed"" is simply explicit for the sake of being so, not to mention a juvenile and clumsy allusion to female ejaculation. It's also hard to take his songs about love seriously regardless of their lyrical content, because Brown's vocals are often processed to the point that he sounds like any generic kid who enters a talent search with any talent other than singing, and then is asked to sing some songs before he takes his show on the road.

Much of F.A.M.E. feels like an album tailor-made for stadium tours and sold out shows, songs more focused on mood and energy than message. Stuff like ""Yeah 3x"" and ""Oh My Love"" just feel like obvious stage moments, points at which Brown's adoring pubescent public can lose their shit to his amazing dance moves while remaining blissfully ignorant to his lip synching. But then there are the songs like ""No Bullshit"" he'll no doubt be expected to slow his sets with. The ""no bullshit"" is his ability to make love for an entire night, of course. He'd also prefer that you ""don't be on that bullshit"" as far as disbelieving him is concerned.

Besides ""Deuces"", the album's lone other triumph (though this in itself is a surprise after Graffiti's ""Transform Ya"" + 12 other faceless songs format) is it's official lead single ""Look at Me Now"". The song is a red herring for the album, as it features some of Brown's rapping and I do admire him for his effort. After all, the song's main point is just to listen to Busta Rhymes and Lil' Wayne kick blisteringly fast triple-time raps over a super fresh Diplo production, and Brown gamely tries to do the same rather than sing. Unfortunately, it's also the home of one of the worst rap lyrics since Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday: ""Oops, I said on my dick, I ain't really mean to say on my dick / But since we talkin' about my dick, all of you niggas say hi to it."" Busta Rhymes may or may not acknowledge the humor in following that monstrosity with his disgustingly Twista impression, but his ""Ay yo, Breezy, let me show you how to keep the dice rolling when you're doing that thing over there, homie"" never ceases to make me giggle like a school girl.

Besides ""Look at Me Now"" and ""Deuces"", though, F.A.M.E. is just as much a graveyard of bland, Radio Disney-oriented pop and dance songs as Graffiti was. Its only saving grace is that Brown isn't wasting our time trying to garner sympathy for beating Rihanna to a pulp here; the bad boy stuff might not ring enjoyable, but at least it's not appalling. Well, besides ""She Ain't You"", a ""Human Nature""-sampling mess about Brown's desires to have a ""bad romance"" with one girl while having simple sex with another. I fail to see the difference between the two, and the song's use of ""Human Nature""'s melodies as a crutch and, I assume, ARK Music Factory as inspiration helps nothing. F.A.M.E. will satisfy 12 year Malibu and Miami beach frequenters, but anyone with a soul should steer far clear of this mess.

Even an extraordinarily great album might not eclipse Brown's past. And this is not a great album."
neg,"In Magic Mike, the new Steven Soderbergh film based on its star Channing Tatum?s real-life experience as a teenage stripper, the central character specializes in contagious delusion. Mike sees himself as a businessman, an artisanal furniture designer, a mentor to his even more na‹ve pupil; anything but a stripper. He refuses to acknowledge who he really is.
Moreover, the enthusiasm and craft with which he drops his drawers are so seductive that they periodically blind his good-girl love interest, who functions as the film?s moral compass. With the help of some slick choreography, Mike transcends his humble background and the seediness of his surroundings to become a genuine artist, like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. And an artist ? at least as one as handsome as Tatum, and as earnest as the rapscallion he portrays ? can, for the length of a fabulous pop tune, get away with nearly anything.
Chris Brown started out a lot like Mike, back before he found himself starring in a much darker, messier movie. Initially marketed by Jive Records as an emphatically 16-year-old yet streetwise African-American variant on the company?s many white teenybopper acts (from Britney to Backstreet Boys), Brown soon transitioned into a young-adult crooner/hoofer positioned somewhere between Michael Jackson and R. Kelly. Following Usher?s footsteps right behind Ne-Yo, the Virginian updated MJ?s dance moves but retained their alchemy: In the video for his 2007 hit ?With You,? Brown seemingly wills his beloved?s appearance solely through the intensity of his moonwalk; even a passing biker gives him an approving nod. His reward: multiple smash hits and the hand of Rihanna, the spoils of a man who?d eclipsed teen-pop status and achieved full-grown R&B legitimacy.
And then, the night before the 2009 Grammys?well, you know the rest. The ballads on that year?s Graffiti, where he acted as if he were the real victim of his domestic-abuse arrest, made a bad situation worse for those still willing to engage with his music at all. The uptempo bangers took him into an adventurous place too European for R&B radio, but not pop enough for Top 40. Still, much of the world quickly learned to forgive and forget, allowing for the possibility, at best, that the 20-year-old Brown was caught in a cycle of abuse instigated by his stepfather, or, at worst, simply blaming Rihanna. Meanwhile, finally Brown cracked the musical code with last year?s chart-topping, Grammy-winning F.A.M.E.: techno for the club crowd (?Yeah 3X,? ?Beautiful People?), techno for the hip-hop crowd (?Deuces,? ?Look at Me Now?), and porno for the slow-jams crowd (?Wet the Bed?). Once again, Brown was omnipresent, and not just in the news.
And he?s not going away. Here?s a partial list of the acts whose records Brown has appeared on over the last two years: Big Sean, Keri Hilson, T-Pain, The Game, Ace Hood, New Boyz, Pitbull, Fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, Nicki Minaj, DJ Khaled, David Guetta, David Banner, Brandy, and Tank. Between those guest spots and 11 charting solo singles since 2011, Brown has been thoroughly normalized on R&B and pop radio: If the rainbow coalition of little kids hanging who react to Brown?s emergence at the beginning of the ?Yeah 3x? video as if he were an ice cream truck represent the comically cute side of his public-image rehabilitation, his notorious, ill-advised appearance on the remix of Rihanna?s awkwardly raunchy ?Birthday Cake? represents the utterly shameless side.
That shameless side, alas, dominates Fortune. The pre-release singles aimed simultaneously at the R&B and pop charts have either stalled (?Sweet Love,? ?Till I Die?) or tanked (?Don?t Wake Me Up?), and deservedly so ? their thin melodies and stock shock lyrics echo better Brown records that are still played everywhere. (Wonder what Brown?s parole officer thinks of the ?Pimps up, hoes down / Ass up, nose down? refrain of the proudly stoned Big Sean/Wiz Khalifa collabo ?Till I Die.?) The rest is even worse. There?s more than the usual number of midtempo ballads that once again mix sex-fantasy titillation with his now-familiar toxic defensiveness: ?Just let the past just be the past,? he sings on ?Don?t Judge Me,? but it?s hard to overlook the elephant in the room when he keeps drawing attention to it. ?You heard about my image, but I could give a flying motherfuck who?s offended,? the anger-management graduate snaps over the dubstep crawl of ?Bassline.?
Brown wants us to accept him as both a bad boy and a rehabilitated lover, a difficult proposition made more challenging by goofy moves like singing, ?You?re my biggest fan / I want you to holla? to his coital companion while accompanied by an actual cheering audience. The album?s most compelling sounds get saddled with songs either forgettable (?Trumpet Lights?) or regrettable (?Mirage,? a sinuous reggae fusion that?s Nas-boosted but unnecessarily nasty). So, all that?s left is ?Turn Up the Music,? the purely uplifting club-pop hit that says more in its aching, wordless chorus than any lyric elsewhere. It?s the only thing here remotely capable of redeeming the album or, more importantly, him.
Fortune makes it easy for Chris Brown?s haters and harder on his many fans. Put ?Turn Up the Music? in the same category as Woody Allen?s Midnight in Paris: great pop art so thoroughly engaged with the power of transcendence that it can momentarily allow you to block out the personal transgressions of the artist, a redemptive force that rises above all the dirt. The rest of this dud just adds to it."
neg,"F.A.M.E. was Chris Brown's first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Five of its singles went Top Five R&B/Hip-Hop, and it took the Grammy for Best R&B Album. The singer clearly feels more emboldened than ever, as he declares in Fortune's second song, the slow motion boom and wobble that is ""Bassline"": ""I'm winnin', you heard about my image, but I could give a flyin' motherfuck who's offended."" Save for a handful of quasi-sensitive ballads that come across as insincere, Fortune is an album of unapologetic swashbuckling. There are few dimensions. In ""Bassline,"" Brown demands ""Get butt naked to my bassline."" The hook to ""Sweet Love"" begins with ""Baby, let's get naked."" That song is followed by ""Strip,"" as in ""Girl, I just wanna see you strip."" Those three lines are among Fortune's cleanest. Even the atmospheric, impeccably-produced ballad ""2012"" -- involving some kind of Mayan apocalypse scenario where Brown and his lover are called upon to reverse the planet's fate -- gets graphic. Each line, from ""Can you feel my submarine?"" to ""Girl, I like the way it opens up when you throw it back,"" has something shameless about it, while ""I got that pillow for your knees right here"" is the closest Brown gets to selflessness. All the way at the other end of the spectrum, ""Girl, you better not change your mind"" -- a prelude to the one-night stand in ""Biggest Fan"" -- is this album's ""Don't you be on that bullshit,"" though it is beyond insolent. None of the dance tracks, including the graceless ""Turn Up the Music"" (featuring some strange likeness to Baltimora's ""Tarzan Boy"") and the shrill ""Don't Wake Me Up,"" rivals Brown's past highlights. From a creative standpoint, this is more a leap than a step backward. Some of the productions, courtesy of the Runners, Adonis, and Kevin McCall, save it from being a disaster."
neg,"Chris Brown?s last album, 2011's F.A.M.E., debuted at the top of the US chart. This one, Fortune, has already spawned a UK number one single called Turn Up the Music. Even Rihanna seems to have forgiven him ? controversially, she recruited her ex to appear on a recent remix. If she?s let him off the hook, it seems the pop-buying public have done likewise.
The tricky question to answer is: why is he enjoying such success? Brown dances like a dream, but on record he's no firecracker, and neither is he the sharpest operator in pop. Recent hits have tended to be club bangers, like Turn Up the Music; but Fortune has just one more of these ? Don't Wake Me Up, which sounds like a smash. It also sounds like it could have been recorded by anyone who doesn't mind Auto-Tune and singing the word ""up"" 70-odd times in three-and-a-half minutes.
Elsewhere, Fortune delivers unremarkable mid-tempo RnB. There's the occasional glimpse of something interesting, but most of the time his producers are content to keep things contemporary but colourless. Brown is invariably upstaged by guest rappers like Nas and Wiz Khalifa, and though he receives a writing credit on every track, he has very little to say.
In fact, Fortune provides just two insights into the psyche of Christopher Maurice Brown. One is that he especially enjoys a pastime called ""sexing""; the other is that he thinks he?s rather good at it. ""I've got that pillow for you, baby, right here / Can you make it disappear?"" he sings on an icky nookie track called 2012. Girls, what do you reckon?
Aside from some gag-reflex-inducing lyrics, though, Fortune is never terrible. It just feels cripplingly pointless, a problem highlighted by a song called Don't Judge Me. From Chris Brown, that's a provocative but potentially interesting title. For what, pray tell, does he want to be let off the hook for? And by whom? The answers: being such a player back in the day, and by his new squeeze."
neg,"Chris Brown may be a grown, 23-year old man at this point but he still sings like a 15-year old, and consistently provides the subject matter to make the sound feel appropriate. The stakes on Fortune are consistently as high as they can possibly be in the way only an adolescent can see them: the end of the world, one chance life-changing sex, music as substitute for carbon or water, Magnum condoms, the finest girls and the trillest marijuana.
Perhaps most importantly, the women Brown comes in contact with come complete with majestically moist vaginas. Chris Brown provides an appealingly maximalist view of the world...that is, provided the drugs have kicked in. To the sober mind, Fortune is another overload of poor decisions just as Brown's previous two albums have been. To his credit, he at least avoids any Rihanna talk or begging for the public to stop reminding him of the decisions he's made.
We've all heard ""Turn Up the Music"", that dance-club torch song that's pretty much all production bravado and glitter. It's disturbingly intoxicating to listen to, but none of the quality of the track is a result of Brown's presence rather than, say, Usher's or Jeremih's. That, of course, remains true throughout the course of the album. ""Bassline"" follows and seems to never end, an exhaustive string of permutations on some cool sounds that fail to coalesce into a cool song while Chris Brown brags about his dick.
Which, if you enjoy, you're in for a treat because there's a lot of Chris Brown's penis on this album. ""Don't Judge Me"" kicks off the Penis Suite with Brown on his knees, begging his main girl to forgive him for having a side chick (key lyric: ""Focus on things that are gonna make us laugh"") but it quickly sets all emotion aside for teenaged porn fantasies. There's ""2012"" (""Buildings and bridges may be falling down / But that won't stop me from turning that thing around"") which posits if the world is about to end, we'll all turn to Brown in the hopes he can blow a model's back out and save us all. It's presented as a sort of sweet love ballad about making her legs shiver and vaginal walls ""rain"", which certainly sounds romantic. Especially with Brown referring to sex as ""doing it.""
My personal favorite lyric resides at the end of ""Biggest Fan""'s final verse. The sweetness of virtue of Brown's words here are just so refreshing to hear amidst all the porn talk. They are as follows: ""I'm kinda tipsy off this wine, so what I say might be a little confusing: I got a Magnum in my wallet. I'ma pull it out, I bet that I'll use it. I'm gonna make you scream."" Listening to this verse, or the opening of ""Strip"" in which he lists the various physical features of a woman that he wants to see nude before proclaiming, ""but don't none of that matter, I'm about to make your pockets fatter: girl, I just wanna see you strip,"" really enlightens me to Brown's flawless logic and affection for women.
Anyway, there's all of that. And then there's the rapping, which can mostly be mentioned in passing because Nas does an abstract parody of his message board reputation (read: phoning it in) and the Big Sean/Wiz Khalifa pairing is a pair of guys rapping about weed and girls for three minutes of a four minute song Brown mostly shies away from, other than the Kanye West impersonation he files away in a manila folder marked ""Please Forget About"". Big Sean even handles hook duty here, leaving Brown essentially irrelevant. Which, you know, isn't that bad of a thought."
neg,"Fortune is the kind of record that will please Brown's many deluded female fans, but we cannot with good conscience give it a single star."
neg,"I don't think this is the best album for Chris Brown. Last year, he was amazing on his F.A.M.E. album with my favorite jams ""Look At Me Now"" and ""Deuces."" But this year, Fortune is one of his biggest downfalls. It's just as disappointing since 2009 when Brown's album ""Graffiti"" wasn't ready for a comeback since he eventually beat up Rihanna and sentenced to a community service where his career was almost in jeopardy. Some of the new material on Fortune just wasn't in the picture. Although I like ""Turn Up the Music"" which he performed at the Grammys last February, but I kinda got a little over on the dance scene. I hope Fortune should be #1, but I gotta believe Bieber, Adele, or Flo Rida could be racing to the top."
neg,This album is so Chris Brown. Extremely boring and generic. There are only 3 good tracks! His previous album seems really good compared to this uninspired album which can be easily called - TRASH!
neg,"Fortune tries to go back to the future for no reason. It tries to be like those 90s album that strive to have a 21st century sound. It pretty much tries too hard, but at the same time keeps what R&B artists try to get away from. (Making the same song on every album.) This album wasn't from the heart, but from the radio."
neg,I really agree with the critics on this album. The singles are good but the majority of the rest of the songs are just slow songs that are too simple for such a famous artist like Chris Brown. A lot of room for improvement. For me this album gets a C-.
pos,"Magical Mystery Tour is a little more scattered and less lively than Sgt. Pepper, but as a progressive and experimental foray, it's one of The Beatles' best, with great classics like ""I am the Walrus"" and ""Hello Goodbye."""
pos,"This is easily my favourite Beatles album, their only album I want to listen to all the way through. Side-A is the sound track to the film, it flows really well and Side-B is that year's singles, that also fit together really well. The result is an album that was very Mode de Jour but that has also stood the test of time."
pos,"Magical Mystery Tour existed mainly as a 6-track, 2-disc EP in the UK, while the US market gathered singles released throughout 1967 to make a full 11-track album. Given the origins of the material here, and the over-the-top production values of the songs, it's a surprisingly consistent album statement, even if it's not quite as brilliant as Revolver or Sgt. Pepper.

The six songs that make up the British EP, and the first side of the American vinyl, are the soundtrack to a UK TV movie that aired on Boxing Day 1967, then again in color about a month later. The movie was the first project after Brian Epstein's death, and also their first critical failure. However, one still views the Beatles for their tunes, not their acting chops, and this album still doesn't disappoint. One of Paul McCartney's best ballads ""The Fool On the Hill"" is here, and the singles side yields ""Hello Goodbye"" and the great ""Penny Lane"". John Lennon's best psychedelic-era tracks are here, with ""All You Need is Love"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", with the enigmatic ""I Am the Walrus"" written deliberately to screw with those attempting to analyze his lyrics.

The Beatles had taken studio experimentation as far as it would go over the last two years. But nobody could produce a catchy experimental piece like the Beatles could, and this album stands as a good example of that as any."
pos,"A gleefully off-the-wall album - even if it isn?t one of the their more important albums, it is certainly one of their most enjoyable and inventive. Nothing really captures the Beatles? psychedelic phase as perfectly as this. And I would struggle to find a sequence of Beatles songs as good as ?I Am the Walrus,? ?Hello Goodbye,? ?Strawberry Fields Forever,? ?Penny Lane,? ?Baby You?re A Rich Man? and ?All You Need Is Love?! Ridiculous!

On a tangential note, this album seems to have been a significant influence on the work of Boards of Canada (though seldom identified as psychedelia, their work in undoubtedly some of the best of the 90s)."
pos,"By virtue of its creation as a sort-of compilation of recent singles and EP's, Magical Mystery Tour does not have the cohesiveness of the Beatles other mid-to-late 1960s records. However, the songs included can hold their own, track-for-track with any other rock record in existence. It is really just one classic followed immediately another, thus it is hard to imagine anyone not thoroughly enjoying repeated listens. Perhaps the most underrated Beatles release, if there is such a thing."
pos,"Actually, not worse than the previous one. But not different - and that's why some get tired.

Best song: I AM THE WALRUS

The LP Magical Mystery Tour is actually an afterthought, consisting of an older EP of the same name containing the soundtrack to the film plus (on Side B) some single A- and B-sides all dating to 1967. Still, none of the songs were previously released on a master disc, so, strictly speaking, this is no compilation.

It was still 1967, and they seemed to still be going psychedelic. People don't revere this album as much as Sergeant, for reasons unknown to me. Maybe they think that first is always best. But they're wrong - this album is just as strong as the previous one, and sometimes even stronger. Actually, one might argue that it's even more spaced out than its predecessor - after all, it was based on the film which was certainly the most hallucinogenous kind of product the Fab Four ever messed up with.

So please don't be lame enough to say 'who needs another Sergeant Pepper'? Everybody. If you have already eaten pizza, why reject a second one? And, like I said, the album is really somewhat different from Sergeant Pepper - basically, it's a bit more diverse and a little more experimental. Actually, there is currently a tendency among reviewers to stress the overall importance and high quality of MMT as opposed to the 'weakness' of Sergeant Pepper. Now this is carrying the anti-hype a bit too far: Pepper might not really be a stronger album, as there are practically no weak spots on both, but both albums are more or less in the same vein, and I have absolutely no problems in giving both a solid, shimmering 5 stars."
pos,"Magical Mystery Tour is a true classic, the inheritor to Sgt. Pepper that may not deviate much from its predecessor but nonetheless comes close to equaling it. The Beatles didn't need to revolutionize the face of rock with each installment in their catalogue, and can be forgiven for an album that's simply excellent as opposed to groundbreaking. Magical Mystery Tour sustains an unbelievably high level of quality for its duration, and deserves the same kind of recognition that the Beatles' most lauded works tend to receive."
pos,"The Beatles should have split up in 1967... before they made Magical Mystery Tour. It's perfectly reasonable to think that Paul McCartney was feeling well chuffed with the ""Sgt. Pepper's"" LP, but that was no excuse to go and put out a film soundtrack that comes across as some sort of gaudy parody of it. That said, I actually really like the title song (""Roll up! Roll up!"" - funny), although Ringo's efforts to kick-start the song back into life after the 'mystical' breakdown section in the middle is aptly appropriate for a band that was running out of creative steam. I like Fool On The Hill; but when you watch the film, you can see McCartney's narcissism is showing just as much as Lennon's. Flying and Blue Jay Way are simply dreadful: self-indulgent twaddle. (The same applies to the LP add-on Baby, You're A Rich Man). Your Mother Should Know is McCartney beginning to push his luck. I Am The Walrus is extraordinary, but when you're not in the mood for it, it all sounds rather ugly. The tracks added to the US LP version improve proceedings no end, making this release a rather old fashioned one, in a way, and it's something that actually fits quite well with the more nostalgia-based themes of the Magical Mystery Tour. But there's no escaping it: This is the beginning of the end for the Beatles."
pos,This record is beyond imagination. All I can say is wow!!! These guys were equal to all the hype. More than equal?
pos,"I think most of the songs as individual tracks are amazing pieces of works , some of their best even, but I don't think it matches the milestones of their previous projects. Keep in mind this is all a soundtrack to the film of the same name, not really an album. Even then, on the U.S release it was accompanied by singles that were already released previously. Again, I think the songs individually do some really great stuff, but nothing really new (in terms of production) is being showcased and as a whole it doesn't strive for the somewhat cohesive structure of Sgt. Pepper. Great music nonetheless though."
pos,"Of the many fantastic albums by the Beatles, this one is the most memorable to me. I believe it may also be their most sonically adventurous. I love their psychedelic style here. It adds to the playful feel. The songs are also deliberate and the tone is so consistent. Everything flows together and just feels ""right"". It makes this album a real trip when I listen to the whole thing in one sitting. Almost every moment of sound is captivating. How the heck do people make albums this good?"
pos,It's like Sgt. Pepper except only this is LOADED OF HITS...it's more enjoyable though..great great songsPure pop psychedelic fun.Never was an album in the UK but this is whitout a doubt the best ''Capitol'' comp suffice to be added to the official discography in 1987.Did somebody says that every song except one had a video clip? 
pos,"The Beatles' relentless musical tour ran in place this time. It took them several months more to realize that their carefully crafted fusion of Dylanesque lyrics and Brian Wilson-esque production values was a dead end, and, instead, to move in a million directions at once on their next album. However, they managed to toss off a superb collection of songs while jogging on their treadmill (title track, modelled on its Sgt. Pepper's counterpart; ""I Am The Walrus,"" another elaborately tripped-out Lennon tune). Paul dominates a bit too much, with some of his upbeat pop numbers wearing thin (""Your Mother Should Know""), but others being marvelous (""Hello Goodbye""). Half the record is a newly-recorded double EP, and the other half is singles from the previous 12 months, including some truly classic hits: John's extraordinary acid-rock production ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" which almost topped the Beach Boys' contemporary ""Good Vibrations""; Paul's marvelous, cleverly orchestrated ""Penny Lane""; and irresistable, perfectly timed Summer of Love anthem ""All You Need Is Love."""
pos,"The Beatles had made many great albums over the past few years. It was time to make something different. This album is funny, inspiring. Although it was no RUBBER SOUL or REVOLVER, it had songs like ""I am the Walrus"", ""the title track, ""Penny Lane"" and ""All You Need Is Love"". ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" is a great song but I hope you don't settle for that (Daniel Amos fans know what I mean). This is such a goofy, awesome album. I'm only hoping they wouldn't have inlcuded ""Baby You're a Rich Man"" to this album."
pos,"Meet the Beatles! wasn't the first Beatles album released in the U.S. (that would've been Introducing the Beatles, on Vee Jay), but as the first Beatles album released by Capitol Records, it was indeed the LP where many millions of Americans were introduced to the Fab Four. As an introduction, there could hardly have been one better. Largely comprised of material released on their second U.K. LP, With the Beatles -- the album art offers a blue-tinted spin on that late-1963 release -- Meet the Beatles! contains nine of that album's 14 songs, cutting out almost all the covers (all the better for publishing rights, but also an effective showcase of the group's talents; it's hard not to view the inclusion of the one remaining cover, ""Till There Was You"" from The Music Man, as a way to illustrate how Meet the Beatles! could appeal to parents) in a quest to trim the LP down to 12 songs. What was added to the With the Beatlesmaterial are three of the Beatles best early songs: their American breakthrough single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and its U.K. B-side ballad ""This Boy,"" plus ""I Saw Her Standing There"" from their U.K. debut Please Please Me (this song was the B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" in the U.S.). The revisions make Meet the Beatles! slightly more of a frenetic rock & roll record than its parent LP -- there isn't much R&B or as many ballads -- which, at the time, made it an appropriate soundtrack for the wild heyday of Beatlemania but, as the years have passed, the emphasis on joyous, exuberant rock & roll means that Meet the Beatles! still sounds fresh and exciting on its own terms. [A 50th Anniversary release of the album included both mono and stereo mixes of the original.]

neg,"Very Unoriginal And Bland... This Whole Album Seems Slapped Together In A Few Hours.. 
One Of The Worst Of 2012 
Turn Up The Music Saves This Album From Getting A One"
neg,"This is the most boring album I have listened to ever. The songs lack any spirit or honesty. It is simply that exudes fakeness. The only reason it doesn't warrant getting a 0 or 1 is because the one exception to the album, 'Don't Wake Me Up.' Maybe Chris Brown should try to develop his music instead of focusing on forging passionless 'futuristic' trash like this."
neg,"Generic, forgettable, excessive auto-tune. Chris Brown needs to step it up. This is really mediocre, his live voice doesn't help, the contrast with the 90% from his performances which are lip synched is cringe worthy."
neg,Not even worth a buy on iTunes. Another generic and disappointing Chris Brown album. All songs are below average except for one: 'Don't Wake Me Up' which has been produced beautifully but ruined by autotune.
neg,"As someone who has purchased all of Chris Brown's previous albums I was highly disappointed. This sounds like an album of leftover mix tapes tracks. Absolute garbage & embarrassing to his catalogue of music. Give us time to miss you Chris, because this was rushed pop garbage."
neg,"Just autotuned to trash. Could be decent if he did not overuse the autotune feature. Not a good song on the album. Would be a waste of money to buy, so save your money and stay away."
neg,"Chris, you're a dope artiste and performer.. but you need to work harder!! dis album was weak and a poor effort and i'm a big fan but you need to work harder to provide better quality music and i know dat u can do much much better!!"
neg,"The computer and the editors running it deserve much more credit than Brown does. But, even with the overused technology, Fortune still blows."
neg,"I found this collection of noise (I won't give it the courtesy of even being called an album) generally unpleasant. The first time you hear it, some of the songs are catchy, I'll give Brown that. However, after listening to it a second, third, or fourth time, you realize you've wasted your time trying to convince your ears that this was even worth listening to. If the songs aren't about sex, they're about how great his life is compared to his haters (which he doesn't even have, might I add); it's just shallow. The only song I found even CLOSE to being written and not just calculated was ""Don't Judge Me"". Even that song, however, turned me off, being that it's an obvious plea to the listener to forgive what he's done, which honestly, comes off as arrogant in my opinion. Don't ASK for forgiveness; you'll get it as society sees fit. As many reviews have already said, the collection of noise wasn't ""written"" per se, but rather ""computed, calculated, and formulated"". It's as if he listened to the radio for hours on end and decided to try and recreate it, which he ultimately failed in doing. The collection is sure to please his blind fans, but to anyone with an ear for good music, this is a piece of garbage. It's simply not worth your time to even consider purchasing this catastrophe."
neg,"A lot of bland pop music that has no staying power and not much going for it beyond being slightly catchy. And definitely nothing to redeem the fact that Chris Brown is an unrepentant woman-beater(a fact that I refuse to leave out no matter how ""irrelevant"" his fans think that is)."
neg,"One of the worst work this year. Most of the tracks can't even be called music. Some can be called NOISE like ""Bassline"" ""Mirage"" ""2012"" and many other ones. ""Turn up the music"" ""Sweet Love""""Don't wake me up""""Till I die"" are the only tracks that are worth listening for a second time while not even one track that is real wonderful."
neg,"Yet, another horrid album from Chris Brown. Graffiti then FAME now this? It has nothing to offer and is incredibly dull. He needs to step it up before he got lost in the lights."
neg,"I honestly just think Chris Brown should just quit at this point. I'm having trouble finding any redeemable qualities about this album. This album is a marker of what is wrong with this generation of music stars. Here we have a talented man who becomes successful off of R&B/Hip-Hop music. In fact, he has multiple top ten hits. So what does he do? Sell out and make generic club music, of course. What else is there to do when a million-or-so people already like your old style? 
Besides, I still don't support him after all his drama. Why should I? "
neg,"""Generic, forgettable, excessive auto-tune. Chris Brown needs to step it up. This is really mediocre, his live voice doesn't help, the contrast with the 90% from his performances which are lip synched is cringe worthy."" I'm in the same line, JUST BAD !"

neg,"While lilwaynehq spams this album with 10 ratings, we all know that it is an awful pop album that proves Wayne's fall off isn't stopping any time soon."
neg,"If you are a optimistic Wayne fan, there is some sharp bright lines and moments that recall the old memorable moments. But the fact is that these moments are lost in the amidst of mediocrity beats, filler choruses, and lazy (sometimes disgustingly so) verses."
neg,"Even in its better moments, FWA suffers from a lack of subject. Wayne shows he is still passionate about his music - and this is definitely his best beat selection since Tha Carter III - but the album is an over-slog of uninspired verses and filler material that doesn't offend, excite or address any issues."
neg,"FWA's opening trio of ""Glory,"" ""He's Dead"" and ""I Feel Good"" is severely tempered by the inclusion of clunky ballads with less-than-inspired production. Lyrically, there is little reference to Wayne's Carter V struggles amidst a wealth of new punch lines, but for every bit of wordplay that has potential to become another Weezy quotable, there is a handful of other cringe-worthy instances to counter."
pos,"It isn't common whatsoever for a debut album to be a masterpiece, but with what great writing, excellent composition, fantastic structure, and good premise there are in this album, it's hard not to be overly impressed with what this has to offer, as it is a timeless classic from the 60s."
pos,"An impressive debut, to be sure. ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Love Me Do"" remain classic Beatles tunes, and when you consider how far the group developed in the next few years, that is saying something. Even so, their incendiary cover of ""Twist & Shout"" arguably eclipses the Isley Brothers original, and certainly outshines anything else on this record. There are a few throwaways, but that is to be expected on any debut LP. All things considered, this is an outstanding and varied collection of pop/rock which showcases the unprecedented talent the Beatles had to offer."
pos,"For an album that was a band's debut and was recorded in one day, Please Please me is truly impressive. It opens with a truly fantastic song in ""I Saw Her Standing There"", which featured great vocals from Paul McCartney. My favorite song on this album has to be ""There's a Place"", as it's a very underrated song from the Beatles' early days. Great harmony with Paul and John Lennon. There's some great covers on this album, too, with John's ""Twist and Shout"" being the most famous and memorable. There's some incredibly underrated covers on this album too, like ""Chains"", ""Boys"", and ""Anna (Go to Him)"". ""Boys"" is particularly underrated, as that track seems to get some shade despite great vocals and drumming from Ringo. That poor guy gets a lot of hate, anyway. This album definitely had it's fair share of filler tracks though, with ""A Taste of Honey"" and ""P.S. I Love You"" being the most notably mediocre. They're both lovey dovey Paul songs, and he'd definitely go on to make better love songs. Speaking of which, this whole album is pretty much just love songs. I'll cut the Beatles some slack, as they had to appeal to their target audience. The Beatles had obviously had not matured into the band they were in later albums, so this ""only"" gets 4.5/5 stars from me. All in all, the Beatles began their legendary career in quite a remarkable way."
pos,"From the opening chords of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to ""Twist and Shout,"" The Beatles' debut highlights the group's live energy and songwriting strength. Recorded, edited, and mixed in just over 25 hours, the mood of the album is raw and exuberant. The explosive sound of ""Please Please Me,"" with its frequent yelps and handclaps, as well as the unusual selection of American songs they chise to cover on the album, emulates the energy of their early R&B and rock 'n' roll influences."
neg,"It's so bad, it hurts! There's no such thing as ""good music"" in this. It's too slow, it lacks emotion and power in the lyrics, vocals and melodies. Don't listen to this, it's bad and totally forgetable."
neg,"Coldplay stop trying to emulate Radiohead. Not even the likes of Jon Hopkins will make you a good band. You're simply a horrid band. There were a few surprisingly decent tracks on here, but not enough to save it from the mess of this album."
neg,"i am a fan since the time between viva la vida or death and all his friends and mylo xyloto. Viva la Vida was a good experiment . Mylo Xyloto was great to sing along songs . But I also think that Parachutes was a very good album and ""a rush of blood to the head"" of one of the best albums ever , and this was by far the best of coldplay . you can?t do an album as a rush of blood to the head every day or year, it is unique. x & y was crap except some tracks. Even though I got relatively late fan, the first two albums were the best. but if coldplay say that they now want to go back to their roots more , ghost stories is a total disaster. except for "" oceans "" there is not only one good song . neither magic nor any other song pulls your mind. not catchy , the songs are quickly forgotten , everything is full of electronic influences , chris martin apparently howling only still around, not like in previous songs where you were really sad about the loss of a great love, now is just crying. this is not a voice it is just a yowling . by far the worst album, even worse than x & y"
neg,"no good album, it is really one of the worst albums in 2014. coldplay did nothing to improve their sound. they created a monstrous, horrible, terrific sound. not the real coldplay."
neg,"What a bad album, martin?s voice is snivelling, the songs are created equal, there is no real hit. not even ""magic"" or ""oceans"" are good. it is worse than x&y. the worst album of coldplay. they wanted to change back, ""recalibrate"", how champion said. it went wrong. hoping for the next album."
neg,"I really hate this album. I really hate this band. I've been TRYING to like them, my friend loves this band but they are absolute crap. This is the WORST album I have listened to all year. I tried to like what my friend describes as their best album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, and that was also absolutely crap. All in all, this band needs to make good music, something tells me that they can."
neg,"this is nothing. coldplay destroyed themselves with this particularly bad album. i won?t buy any coldplay songs anymore. why should i, after this bad stuff?"
neg,"For a record whose lyrics are meant to reflect a deeply personal music journey, the music finds Coldplay at the safest and most rote it has ever been."
neg,"There was a time when X&Y was regarded as the worst Coldplay album by old fans, but now this album is the worst. I am truly disappointed, Mylo Xyloto was good after a few listens, but I just find this album unbearable to listen to, at all."
neg,"Weakest album to date. A disappointment for me, the album opens up with a beautiful ballad ""Always in My Head"", ""Magic"" is boring and typical, ""Ink"" is just a no for me, ""True Love"" is another gorgeous Alternative-RNB ballad that's is peacefully relaxing, ""Midnight"" doesn't even sound like a Coldplay song, ""Another's Arms"" is another typical/boring song, ""Oceans"" is positively reminiscent of ""Green Eyes"" from A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), ""A Sky Full of Stars"" is an beautiful, upbeat song produced by Avicii and is sung by Chris Martin; in addition there are two music videos that were filmed for this song, one of them being scrapped, the other being publicly released, the scrapped one is more interesting, and less cheesier than the main music video. The album closes with an pop ballad ""O"", the song (which is really good) just feels like it was about to be left off of the album with eight tracks. ""O"" would probably be a track left off from Mylo Xyloto (2011). Overall, standout tracks of the album are (only), ""Always in My Head"", ""True Love"", ""A Sky Full of Stars"", and ""O"""
neg,"Overproduced, no relatable lyrics, poor voice... this is Rihanna's music. You won't miss much if you decide to skip this album, or her discography for that matter."
neg,"Aren't people tired of listening to the same over produced, emotionally & vocally void tripe masquerading as 'music'. Rihanna has constantly brought nothing new to the table and reconfirms my believe that new music these days is not even worth the listen!"
neg,"Rihanna is not an artist, she is simply a cute girl that def jam found and gave her all the financial support she needed to make a hit album. She has no talent. She's no better than the singers who are on american idol for gods sakes, and at least they ahve real talent. Rihanna has to resort to repetitive choruses such as ""umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay"" or ""shut up and drive-ive-ive-ive"" HOW IS THAT TALENT!?!?!? Again we should thank the producers of this album for making it work around a singer with no talent, because that IS impressive. Repetitive hooks DO NOT = good album. This CD is like a headache on repeat. I would rather somebody fart in my ear for 1 hour than listen to ANYTHING Rihanna has to say. And for you people talking about ""dem haters"" just do not know good music. Go turn on your radios and listen to EVERYTHING that comes out of it and automatically assume its good. Because that is obviously the type of fans Rihanna is relying on. You people who don't form your own opinions but allow record execs to do it for you. Mindless idiots THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL"
neg,"If Umbrella is anything 2 go by, den this album will be the most overated thing ever on CD"
neg,"Very predictable I knew in the begining it was her. I knew every step of the movie. NO surprises here. It could have been good with bettter writers. A movie does not take good to make millions. What a joke. I almost fell asleep in the beginning, and the scene where she was robbed was stupid."
neg,"Wow, Im shocked at these reviews, Not too shocked because Critics Overrate & Underrate thing all the time. Poor Rihanna, She thought she could pull off another collapse"
neg,"One of the worst albums of the year thus far. It shows absolutely no artistic growth, the lyrics are elementary, and the vocals are non-existent. All in all, a terrible album. Collapse"
neg,"lyrical mediocrity overshadows any skill that kanye has behind the boards, not to mention his ridiculous pretentious content. somebody call puffy and tell him a twin brother has been discovered. Peace"
neg,"Whenever I hear Kanye rap it makes me wanna puke up my pelvisbone and beat myself to death with it. He's so bad lyrically, a deaf pigeon would spit better. And his production? Please! He was never original, he just started making extremely boring beats, and then kept making the same song for 3 albums. I hate Kanye West. Can't he ever shut the hell up? And can please all the tonedef reviewers out there stop thinking he is good, he's not. He has one flow, one! and its so incredibly annoying.. Like a mosquito when you are trying to sleep. I'd prefer the latter"
neg,Kanye West is just trash. His music does not even sound like HIP hop its some trash mix of Back Street boys and M J and add some black ness to it. I can not belive anyone likes this guy. 50 cent is a heck lot better. Fuck Kanye that Cock sucker
neg,TOTAL CRAP!!! better off burning 12 bux than buying this cd
neg,"More like regurgitation. This is just an awful album in terms of production, lyrics, and just everything. By far Kanye's worst. Not anything I ever want to listen to again."
neg,"Disappointing. Feels rushed and commercial. There are few moments that there are flashes of Coldplay, but not a lot. I feel we have been on the ride for all the albums. Stuck in there for Mylo Xyloto and it paid off, much of the album aged pretty well. Ghost stories for me echoed some of more mellow darker sounds of Parachutes. This album doesnt have the quality ring of Mylo Xyloto, but tries to pump up the same upbeat sound. I don't think it will grow on me. And for me 'Hymn for the weekend' is the final straw. A drinking song on a Coldplay album just seems kind of cheap. Lets hope this hits the discount pile as quickly as possible so we can feel a bit better shilling out only a few dollars for this one."
neg,Their last 3 or 4 albums including this one--just aren't very good. Chris Martin's mediocre and maudlin lyrics used to be forgiven early on because the music was so good--but he should have gotten better by now--and he hasn't. The lyrics on this record are cringe worthy--and thematically (musically) there just isn't any cohesion. A Head Full of Dreams is a mess.
neg,"Coldplay have definitely lost their way. They're trying to reinvent themselves on every new release since Mylo Xyloto, and while they were achieving something with some songs on Ghost Stories, with this album they confirm their unbelievable descent. In this record they're tryin' to hard to be ""indie"", and the amount of color put in the cover of the album should warn you about the amount of gumminess put in the production of the songs: every sound feels nauseating and clich?, and the pseudo-lofi patina present in each song is suffocating and makes you reject everything they're proposing you in this horrible album. "
neg,This album was bad I didn't enjoy it one bit I will move straight on to the next album after being put through this. It was awful like some albums I have reviewed but it wasn't good either so listen to it and judge for yourself.
neg,This is probably the worst album ever!They make pop and r n b music for money and succes!!!Is far the most wrong album they ever made!The songs are so sadly low!Ok im rating this with 3!!! It deserve it
neg,"Remember how Coldplay was a manly, guilty pleasure you didn't have to be ashamed of? That time is gone. This experimenting genre they're going through at the moment is ridiculous. Mylo Xyloto was already pushing the boundaries but was still musically and lyrically solid. This album is just  Adventure of a Lifetime is a disappointing song coming from Coldplay, if it was from a more unknown band I would have liked it, but the bar is set higher for Coldplay. Even collaborating with Noel Gallagher in Up&Up couldn't save this album. Please, if you do make another album make a similar album to the first 5 albums."
neg,"Coldplay has managed to continue with their decline, publishing yet another unpolished and repetitive album. The genre of music is unfitting and ""trash"". I hate listening to it. I feel like it gives me a virus. Don't even mention the hip style of it and the cover and the music videos.... I'm starting to lose faith in this band. I recall the good old days where they were still good. Once again disappointed"
neg,"This group makes me compare their past work. And I tell you. That's horrible. With this album, like the only song from the last album, like all the songs. There is a difference? There is."
neg,"The head feels weighed down with unresolved torment, the smile forced and awkward, the colours garish and messily-applied."
neg,Coldplay's seventh album A Head Full of Dreams is insufferably bland at best and downright offensive at worst
neg,"I do not know how this album has a score of 65. This is not real rap. The only things he talks about it money, sex, and drugs. The lyrics in his songs are overly repeated, with only some creative wordplay. The only reason why people love lil wayne is because he raps slow, and everybody can catch and repeat his words (which are meaningless). I do not know how this talentless artist got into this rap game, Oh wait! his dad was a rapper too! (and he also sucks at rapping!)"
neg,"Lil' Wayne is a joke. He thinks he's a good rapper which is incredibly surprising considering he has one trick (his punchlines), which he uses too much. He has lost all his creativity and originality. The ""Best rapper alive"" is a horrible artist who has become predictable on this album"
neg,"Just horrible. Lil Wayne might have had talent when he first started, but this is just horrible. His lyrics most of the time make no sense and have nothing new to offer, he still will not shut up about how he believes he is the greatest rapper ever and he does not attack any issues other them himself, or just plain pointless issues. The beats are bad, the lyrics are bad, the flow is bad, Lil Wayne is bad. "
neg,this album suck's lil wayne is the worst rapper alive and the worst musician alive this album suck's the lyric's suck as well!
neg,"this album sucks so much dick and shit it's not even funny. shit lil wayne he is SOOOOOOOOOO damn wack he shouldn't be making music anymore. his career should be DEAD. HE SHOULD BE DEAD. he's the ""HIP-HOP KILLER"" thats what lil wayne is."
neg,"The first IANAHB album was quite terrible. His wordplay is probably what stands out the most in this album, most of the beats weren't the best and some of his features actually made the album better in some ways. One thing I dislike about artists' albums is when they put their mixtape tracks on their albums, it's lazy. He did this with one song I didn't find enjoyable and that was ""Single"". To summarise, the album doesn't contain many standout tracks, it lacks creativity and direction"
pos,"An absolutely magical debut album, which proves that same old rock and roll can be performed differently. You can feel the McCartney/Lennon cooperative magic already blossoming. The tunes are so catchy that after listening to this album even once you will remember most of the songs for the rest of the life. Oh, and the vocal harmonization. ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS! This album has endured the test of time, I could not imagine how it must have felt in 1963. 

My personal favorites ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Please Please Me"" are so powerful that you could already see a tremendous potential that this band would have to offer in the coming years.

One of the strongest debut albums in the history of modern music with an incredibly powerful opening track."
pos,Few rock and roll albums were this consistent when this LP appeared...a stage show of The Beatles(minus the Chuck Berry covers) captured in the studio in few live takes.The covers are lovely but the originals are more than special..And Ringo deserved his place in the band with great drumming that you can't heard on the Polydor and Decca tapes.But John stoles the show with incredible singing.5 stars 
pos,"Really freaking good, considering both that it was the group's debut and that this was made in 1963. It's obviously not up to the standards of their later masterpieces, but it's still a very solid recording, with most of the songs lying somewhere between good and great (even by today's standards).
overall, good stuff. I wouldn't get it early, and I certainly wouldn't get it before A Hard Day's Night, but it's still a very worthwhile addition to any record collection. And remember, it only got better from here "
pos,"From the opening chords of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to ""Twist and Shout,"" The Beatles' debut highlights the group's live energy and songwriting strength. Recorded, edited and mixed in just over 25 hours, the mood of the album is raw and exuberant.

pos,"The Beatles doesn't need any introduction. They were the greatest pop/rock band ever. Their debut album was too poppy for me - at first. Eventually I started to like it more and more. The songs such as ""P.S. I Love You"", ""Love Me Do"", and ""I Saw Her Standing There"" are classic songs, at least their were at that time. It is a very good album but if you compare it to their later works, you understand there's much more to achieve. I got the feeling they had very much fun while making this album. The album sounds very refreshing although it has songs such as ""Misery""."
pos,"OooooooEEEEEE! This album is so much damn better than anything else released in 1963 that it's not even funny. No, it is funny...about as funny as the episode of 'What's Happenin' when D-wayne (I think that was his name...it's been a long, long road, you know) wants to go see the Doobie Brothers and calls their hotel room and asks 'Which Doobie You Be?' and it was HILARIOUS for a 10 year old such as myself who'd only just recently exhausted the humor content of boogers. Except for this joke...and watchout, 'cos this ones a doobie:"
neg,"One day, either in this life or the next, Britney Spears will have to atone for unleashing Kevin Federline upon the world. A onetime backup dancer for Justin Timberlake, LFO, and Britney herself, Federline was not just a nonentity prior to romancing Spears, he was a nonstarter, a cog in the machinery of the lower rungs of the pop music industry and destined to be nothing more. But Brit-Brit, reeling from her momentary marriage to childhood friend Jason Alexander, saw something buried behind the skeevy look in his eyes and decided that Kevin Federline was her soulmate. This was something that shook her to her core, so she decided to share him with the world, so we could all see just how special he is. Foremost among her efforts to explain the inexplicable was the unwatchable 2005 reality series Chaotic, which chronicled their banal courtship in numbing detail. A cursory glance at the show -- and, really, it was impossible to watch it for much longer than that -- revealed how desperately lonely Britney was at the moment she fell for Federline, who swiftly seduced her with a charm detectable only by Britney herself. He left his pregnant fiancee and young child, joined her on tour, and she fell completely under his spell, quickly marrying the former backup dancer, dragging him along to tabloid stardom and the delusions of grandeur that accompany such status. Well, stardom might be overstating it: notoriety is a more accurate term, since the average person on the street did not know who he was, and those who did -- mainly gossip mavens -- reveled in his loutish behavior, which was the only accomplishment outside of paternity he could call his own. Like Paris or Nicole, he was a celebrity, celebrated for nothing more than being Kevin.

And, like Paris or Nicole, he wanted more than just headlines to his name; he wanted something tangible to justify his stardom, something like a record. When there are millions of dollars in your family -- either by blood or marriage -- such dreams are attainable, so Kevin was on his way toward a recording career. Soon, he was dubbed as an ""aspiring musician"" in the tabloids, which soon gave way to ""aspiring rapper."" The fruits of his labor were first tentatively revealed when a portion of ""Y'all Ain't Ready"" was leaked on the Net toward then end of 2005. It may have lasted no longer than a minute, but that minute was jam-packed with memorable absurdity, most notably his timeless malapropism of calling paparazzi ""Pavarottis"" and his boast that his style was ""straight 2008"" when his sleepy drawl and backing track recycled every white wannabe-gangsta clich‚ from the past 15 years. Bloodied but not beaten, K-Fed -- which he was now being called, with absolutely no irony on his part -- unveiled his first full-length single on New Year's Day 2006. ""PopoZao"" -- a celebration of Brazilian ass -- was let loose on the Internet, where it was greeted with unfettered and deserved ridicule, as it lived up to the promise of ""Y'All Ain't Ready."" Both singles were awful, but they were gloriously awful, the work of a hack who believed he was a genius and was surrounded by yes-men who were either too well paid to tell him otherwise, or were laughing behind his back as they gave him enough rope to hang himself high. It was the kind of music that was a marvel because it was so naturally, inadvertently funny, and these two early singles raised expectations for Federline's debut, since they suggested that this had the potential to be a comedy classic -- something that would finally reward all of us who have had to put up with his smirking rat face for two years that have felt like an eternity.

Alas, such hope was in vain. Federline's debut album, Playing with Fire, is indeed bad, but it's bad in an uninteresting way; it's as dull and predictable as its title. Clearly, the early ridicule bestowed upon ""PopoZao"" and ""Y'All Ain't Ready"" had an effect upon Kevin -- not to inspire him to do better, but rather to not stray beyond the watered-down Snoop Dogg impression that turns out to be his signature. Ignore K-Fed's bragging -- to a synth line borrowed from ""The Final Countdown,"" no less -- that he has that ""hip-hop flavor mixed with a little bit of rock & roll""; there's nothing but outdated G-funk and West Coast beats here, music that's been heard countless times before, usually as the generic soundtrack to inner-city crime on CSI or Law & Order, and his stoned, self-satisfied drawl disappears into the repetitive, bass-heavy throb of the music. Indeed, whenever a guest is brought into the studio -- Ya Boy on the charming ""Dance with a Pimp,"" Bosko on ""Privilege,"" or Britney herself on ""Crazy,"" where she sings the hook on the latest attempt to mythologize their pedestrian romance (not coincidentally, that hook is the only memorable piece of music on the record) -- they draw attention away from the man of the hour, because unlike him, they have some degree of presence and charisma. But if there is anybody listening to Kevin, they're not listening for the music or his skills as a rapper: they want to hear his lyrics, they want to laugh at him, not with him, as he strives to top ""I know y'all wishin' you was in my position/Cause I keep gettin' into situations/That you wish you was in, cousin."" And although he's ""coming out like Janet's titty at the Super Bowl,"" he's not nearly as shocking as he'd like to believe or as amusing as his haters would hope: he just comes across as a big boob. He has some moments of insight (""I know I'm not a nerd/But I know how to calculate them birds""), has a way with a simile (""It's going down like a fresh pair of panties""), and a flair for left-field pop culture references (""I'm like Val Kilmer how I'm bringing this heat""), but throughout Playing with Fire Federline is far too serious about being taken seriously to get unintentionally silly, and the album is a bore because of it.

It's also a bore because he's a boor, writing endlessly about the same three topics: his alleged superstardom, his hatred of the media, his love of parties and dope. While the old rule that writers should write what they know may hold true, the unspoken part of that maxim is that the writing should either be interesting or done well, two goals that are well beyond Federline's reach. Never mind writing well: competence is barely within his grasp, as it often sounds like he can't quite understand the meaning of what he's saying, whether he's casually blaspheming (""Like Jesus in every way/I'm crucified every day""), suggesting that he loves dope as much as he loves his wife (""fell in love with the herbs just like my wife,"" which could indeed mean that Britney also loves ganja; either is possible, and it doesn't really matter which is true), serves up his career plans (""got tired of the drugs so I switched to rap""), and offers up a self-description so pungent and succinct it could stand as his epitaph: ""This marijuana has got me heavily sedated/I'm Kevin Federline, America's Most Hated."" He's onto something there: America does indeed hate him, but it's not an active, consuming hatred, it's a mild, persistent annoyance, the way that a dumbass brother-in-law gets on your nerves. And that's really what Federline is: the guy in your life that you wish would just quietly disappear, but he won't, since he's married into your family and you're now stuck with him. K-Fed may not be related to America by law, but as long as he's married to a superstar, we're stuck with him popping up a couple times a year, as if he wants to remind us that he is just as shallow, tasteless, and stupid as we remember -- and there is no greater testament to his utter emptiness than this stultifying record. Years, or perhaps months, from now after Britney has finally left this guy and he's disappeared to wherever Carlos Leon now spends his days, perhaps we'll all look back and laugh, but the worst thing about Playing with Fire is that it's too stale and inept to inspire laughter: it can only elicit weary groans, just the way another Pavarotti pic of K-Fed on the cover of US Weekly or Star does."
neg,"In general, Federline enunciates well."
neg,"His flow is generic and instantly forgettable and his lyrics are trite, inconsequential and full of self-importance."
neg,This disc is just as disposable and dumb as you'd expect.
neg,"His constipated, region-nonspecific flow overwhelms even the most flamboyant beats."
neg,Federline's rhyme flow is the opposite of tight.
neg,"Other rappers might hesitate to brag about marrying into bling, but Federline isn't self-conscious about it."
neg,"I think that even the critics had hard time remain objective to this album. It has couple of listenable songs and Federlines rap flow is no worse than Eminems for example. I dont know if the music is the most important thing when you listen to rap, but if thats the case I heard worse. Though K Feds lyrics are hidious he has salvaged some songs on this album with a decent production."
neg,This has to be the worst album of the decade. KFed needs another occupation because he cannot cut it in the music industry.
neg,"This is what happens when a random, white, American dumbass gets lucky. Kfed, you had your big chance, a one in a million chance, to create art and have it available to the masses. And this is what you produce? Sure, no one (and deep down inside you know this too) was surprised by how terrible a musician you are. What is tragic is that Britney could have married one of millions and millions of talented yet poor musicians all over American. But she married you, o mighty juggernaught of suck, o grand prince of lame. It's just not fair. At the very least, you have reminded us all of that sad fact. Life is just not fair. "
neg,"I'd rather sit through an 8 hour loop of Justin Bieber's ""Baby"" than listen to this record ever again. I'd swear to god that if you gave a piece of paper and crayons to a 3 year old the lyrics he would come up with would sound like the Beatles compared to this. 

Please, remember the name K-Fed 
And I ain't even drunk, the media want Kev dead 
Twistin' up every little word that Kev said 
Well tell them shit they can give Kev head"
neg,"It's quite difficult to give an album 0 out of 10. It's effectively saying, it wasn't even worth the time, money and effort in the studio to create. On this occasion however, this album really is a zero if there ever was one. Never has a rap album flowed so badly. Lyrically, it is easily one of the worst album's I have ever come across. Take ""Im livin' life in the fast lane, then the cash came, fire wont quit, still burnin like a gas flame"" as an example. The amount of upcoming underground US artists that could've been selected to record an album, and yet Kevin Federline was given the green light just because he was Britney Spears' husband at the time. Absolute disgrace. Waste of time, money and effort."
neg,"Putting all of the news headlines aside, and really listening to this material, all I can say is, you have to be kidding me. An absolute joke. It's a crime if this guy makes one stinking dollar off this crap. What an insult. Thank God I listened to someone elses copy and did not waste any of my money, but it did waste my time. And to really fuel my dislike, is the fact that he is a leech, only able to live off of others. He is self centered and disrespectful and deserves nothing until he grows up. Give it up dude. Go back to dancing or whatever it is you do."
neg,"I am disgusted by this album. I agree with the song ""America's Most Hated"".. He is truly America's most hated."
neg,"The sound of poor African people dieing of diarrhea sounds more exciting then buying, or listening to this album, or even thinking of this album."
neg,i read a comment earlier where someone who liked the album compared it to ebola...i have to admit it is very much like ebola and listening to the album makes my insides want to liquify...a certainly more pleasant experience than listen to this. not even worth the disc the printed it on.
neg,This is so excruciatingly painful I would liken the feeling to an alligator biting off the tip of my penis.
neg,"In 2006, the first year of the beast in the new millenium, the unholy union of a wigger and a washed-up pop star will result in the birth of the AntiChrist, signaling the end of civilization as we know it. No, Jayden isn't the AntiChrist, its this album! Listening to this album will cause massive bleeding from the ears and delirium, but playing the CD backwards will unleash the demons of Hell onto the world! Did you think the album's release date on Halloween and the re-release of The Omen on 6/6/2006 was a coincidence? It was a prophesy of what was to come. Repent your sins, for the end is nigh!"
neg,"Takes the most commercialized forms of rap music and slaps them all together, then tops it all off with his pretentious, self-absorbed lyricisms that clearly exaggerate his proposed ""greatness."" Awful CD"
neg,WOW!!!!!! when i poped this in thd record pplayer i just said WOW!!!!! KEvin federline is a really good rapper whose make good music and love. IF You're looking of good music look no longer!!! KEVIN IS MY SAVOR!!!!!! p.m.s. he's also better than britnay sopers who i love
neg,"Gawd-awful. An insult to intelligence. Commercial oblivion here comes K Fed...........never to darken the doorstep of the charts, for good reason."
neg,"Please tell me that now they've split up, he'll go back to wherever he came from... and get the hell away from a recording studio"
neg,"I never heard the album, but I know its garbage. I also did this to bring down his score, because at the moment its a 2.6, which he does not deserve. The only thing he did right was promotoe it.

pos,"The Beatles at their lightest - heck, the album seems to be floating five inches above ground all the time.
"
pos,"Surprisingly, about half of this is dominated by cover songs - mostly girl group, R & B, and Broadway show tunes. It all was recorded in one marathon session, and although the Beatles were up to the challenge, the material seems thin so many decades later. Nonetheless, there are some well-known rockers (""I Saw Her Standing There""; ""Twist And Shout"") and Lennon-McCartney pop songs (title track; ""Love Me Do""; ""P.S. I Love You""), five of which hit the Top Ten at once, but only after the follow-up LP hit like a tidal wave in the U.S."
pos,"Ultimately Please Please Me is an impressive debut, but its quality's been over inflated due to its status as a Beatles product. It lacks the stellar originals of the Who's debut and the exceptional instrumental skills displayed on the Stones' first outing. It does demonstrate that the group possessed extraordinary talent even from the beginning, but in their embryonic state they were incapable of harnessing this talent and directing it in a more impressive fashion."
pos,"This is the Beatles at their rawest and that lends it a unique charm that the rest of their discography does not entail. Their harmonies and instrumentation is at worst, in one ear and out the other, but is often pleasant to listen to. It's more of an interesting debut than it is a flawless masterpiece, but there is still a lot to love.

It's mostly the hit songs that don't work for me, or at the very least I believe are over-rated. ""I Saw Her Standing There"" isn't all that bad, though I always find the ""She was just 17, if you know what I mean"" peculiar seeing as Paul was 21, but it is still a decent rocker. The one that really doesn't mesh well with me is the title track which just sounds too cheesy to for me to buy into, and the harmonica in the chorus really doesn't help. It does feature some nice back and forth with the ""Come on, come on"" in the pre-chorus. My favorite of their singles off of the album is ""Love Me Do"" which seems to be the one most people like to pick on due to the nonsensical lyrics. ""Love Love Me Do, You Know I Love You, I'll Always be True, So Please Love Me Do."" I still enjoy it, mostly due to the excellent harmonica and catchy harmonies. Plus the Beatles were mostly about their music, not their lyrics, if you can bop your head to the super-cheese lyrics of ""She Loves You"" then I can't understand how someone could hold it against ""Love Me Do"".

The non-singles are much better in my opinion, and this is the only Beatles album where their covers are some of their best works. John Lennon's two best songs are both covers, with the obvious standout ""Twist and Shout"" having John sing himself ragged, giving the song its charm. You can't help feel John's energy when he's singing so hard he can barely even summon the voice to shout anymore. The lesser known cover that is a highlight is the beautiful ""Anna (Go to Him)"", with its notable guitar riff easily worming into your ear. On the other side of the spectrum we get ""Boys"" a girl group song where Ringo takes the vocals, is easily one of the most awkward parts of their catalog and can be easily skipped over. Ringo doesn't really contribute any memorable songs until the Beatles studio era.

Along with ""Twist and Shout"" my other favorite from this album is George's (though Lennon wrote it) ""Do You Want to Know a Secret?"". I love it when the Beatles make room for us to listen to them as background singers and they do that in spades here, George also sounds fantastic. Those two tracks are the only two I would deem as absolutely necessary for anyone to listen to.

Lots of the tracks are somewhat similar so going in depth about each of them would be a waste of time. Recorded over a mere three days, it is a perfect replica of their Cavern Club set-list, but there is a reason why the polish would be added later, it enhanced their sound that much more. Plus the Lennon-McCartney combo needed a bit of growth in the songwriting department."

I guess I have have to return to only listening to Britney. John said that he really digs that Womanizer tune. Power to the people. Just not the black ones. "

I mean, this is just the worst album ever released. It makes Hannah Montana a Grammy winner! As I read before, there are millions of talented but unsigned musicians out there, but as soon as a moron who didn't finish high-school like you marries a famous and gorgeous singer as Britney, you got the chance. You got the chance to prove that you had a teensy bit of talent...but it turns out there is no talent to prove! Bad lyrics, God awful voice and just an awful album. Shame on the people who spent money on this piece of crap!"

neg," guess I'll add my score to the Legions of Zeroes. This guy is the human representation of everything that is wrong with our popular culture. A total no-talent, and I'm being kind, the only reason he got in the door of a recording studio was because of his ex-wife, another staggering waste of oxygen. Our airwaves are no longer priveleged for the talented and deserving. They've become the sanctuary of the sheep who exalt the refuse of American Idol Nation, and this guy doesn't even qualify on that account. To even define what he does as ""music"" is to truly play with fire. Maybe some clueless music industry executive will wake up long enough from reading the stock page to smell just how bad the Sewerstream stinks and pull this slug's recording contract. Then he or she might focus on doing to Brittany what she did to this Warholian nightmare. Like lawyers at the bottom of the ocean, it would be a good start."
pos,"All the rules fell by the wayside with Revolver, as the Beatles began exploring new sonic territory, lyrical subjects, and styles of composition. It wasn't just Lennon and McCartney, either -- Harrison staked out his own dark territory with the tightly wound, cynical rocker ""Taxman""; the jaunty yet dissonant ""I Want to Tell You""; and ""Love You To,"" George's first and best foray into Indian music. Such explorations were bold, yet they were eclipsed by Lennon's trippy kaleidoscopes of sound. His most straightforward number was ""Doctor Robert,"" an ode to his dealer, and things just got stranger from there as he buried ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" in a maze of multi-tracked guitars, gave Ringo a charmingly hallucinogenic slice of childhood whimsy in ""Yellow Submarine,"" and then capped it off with a triptych of bad trips: the spiraling ""She Said She Said""; the crawling, druggy ""I'm Only Sleeping""; and ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" a pure nightmare where John sang portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead into a suspended microphone over Ringo's thundering, menacing drumbeats and layers of overdubbed, phased guitars and tape loops. McCartney's experiments were formal, as he tried on every pop style from chamber pop to soul, and when placed alongside Lennon's and Harrison's outright experimentations, McCartney's songcraft becomes all the more impressive. The biggest miracle of Revolver may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly. Either way, its daring sonic adventures and consistently stunning songcraft set the standard for what pop/rock could achieve. Even after Sgt. Pepper, Revolver stands as the ultimate modern pop album and it's still as emulated as it was upon its original release."
pos,"Even in lives that moved at lightning speed, the Beatles? upheavals of 1966 were startling. Maturing overnight from happy mop-tops to psychedelic gurus, they revolutionized their own style and rock music itself. Thanks to innate genius, some studio wizardry and perhaps a touch of chemical inspiration, Revolver overturned the conventions of pop with the boldest innovations of the band?s career."
pos,"Their first psychedelic masterpiece, Revolver represents the Beatles at their most creative and cohesive, still a tight rocking unit firing on all cylinders but with a surging freedom of self-expression. It is arguably their greatest album, in which they introduce whole new vistas of sound yet still contain them within tightly structured and performed songs.
There is just so much going on: Indian tablas and sitars creating mystical magic for Harrison?s droning Love You Too, a sawing string quartet driving the heartbreaking vignette of loneliness in Eleanor Rigby, the ripe horns surging through the soulful Got to Get You Into My Life, recorded history?s first backwards guitar solo on the dreamy I?m Only Sleeping, dynamic twin lead on the blistering rocker And Your Bird Can Sing, the snappy R&B and political sniping of Taxman, the gorgeous harmonies of McCartney?s favourite ballad Here, There and Everywhere, tape loops, mountainous drumming and a spirit of anything-goes madness blowing out on the utterly extraordinary psychedelic epic Tomorrow Never Knows. Even Ringo, reliably the singer of the Beatles? worst songs, is well catered for with the surrealist children?s playground classic Yellow Submarine.
Before the woolly politics of flower power had really taken over psychedelia, Revolver remains sharp and acerbic, its cutting quality emphasised by great electric guitar-playing from both George and John. The band looked fantastic, too, in hipster suits and dark glasses. Pound for pound and song for song, Revolver is as good as it gets, a real monster.

"
pos,"Revolver is often heralded as the best Beatles album and one of the greatest albums of all time. The Fab Four are undeniably on top form, with each member leaving their own blueprint on this record. John Lennon and Paul McCartney cement their place among the most talented and inventive songwriters of the century, each developing a distinct style of songwriting and genre exploration that provides a compelling contrast throughout the record. The album?s themes expand upon the darker and more mature content touched upon in Rubber Soul, with several songs expressing loneliness, sorrow and detachment. George Harrison proves that he is a fine songwriter too, and the album is packed with his tuneful and experimental guitar riffs. Even Ringo gains protagonism, narrating the surreal ""Yellow Submarine? and laying out some memorable drumbeats. While the Beatles would later continue to drift into more adventurous territory, Revolver redefined the possibilities and expectations of pop/rock music for upcoming generations of artists. 

The album is packed with individual highlights, each of which could kick-start a revolution of their own. First off is ?Taxman"", Harrison's political statement which counts with psychedelic guitar melodies that give a taste of things to come. Next is ""Eleanor Rigby"", a carefully arranged chamber pop song similar in feel to ?For No One?, another McCartney composition. ?I?m Only Sleeping? features a reversed guitar solo played by Harrison that feels as hazy and dreamy as Lennon's laid-back lyrics. In ""Love You To?, Harrison finds innovative forms of rocking a sitar, while in ""Here, There and Everywhere"" McCartney draws inspiration from The Beach Boys' ?God Only Knows? to write another touching and immortal love song. The nonsensical ""Yellow Submarine? offers amusing lyrical imagery and has since become an internationally renown children?s song. Closing the first half of the album is ""She Said She Said"", where Byrds-like jangling guitar riffs are fused with Ringo?s hypnotic drumming and lyrics inspired by actor Peter Fonda?s LSD freakout. 

The second half of the album is just as mesmerising. ""Good Day Sunshine? is cheerful and radiates happiness in an otherwise chaotic ride. While Lennon addresses his drug dealer in the catchy ?Doctor Roberts?, McCartney's innocent-sounding ?Got to Get You into My Life"" is an ode to pot in disguise. The culmination of this drug-fuelled odyssey is undoubtedly ?Tomorrow Never Knows?, an appropriate and unforgettable album closer that predates the sound of The Chemical Brothers by decades. Here, Lennon reads extracts from the Tibetan Book of the Dead over Ringo?s entrancing drumbeat and layers of loops and trippy guitar effects. It is admirable that despite such bold experimentation none of the songs backfire, but are instead among The Beatles' most original and beloved tracks. Vote for whichever party includes this in their education reform programme!"
pos,"This album doesn't flaunt its genius. That's what's so great about it. You listen to it, you think, ""Okay, this is pretty good, I guess"" and then you listen to something else and think, ""Well, that was pretty good, but I think I'd rather listen to Revolver"". And then you slowly realize you have that same reaction to almost everything else you own. You don't understand why, since it doesn't really feel like a major statement, much less a masterpiece, and yet that's exactly what it is. Listeners who were around when this album first came out will surely disagree with this review (though hopefully not the star rating this reviewer has given) and wonder how anyone could think this was anything but a monumental event, but that just proves how much of an influence this album has been to subsequent musicians. It was radical at the time, but its innovation may be lost on modern listeners because so many of its revolutionary techniques are now commonplace. Even so, it maintains a freshness few other albums hold even a decade after their release, and the songwriting has rarely been equalled. The cool kids will tell you The Velvet Underground & Nico is the most influential album of all time. Us dorks know it's this one."
pos,"After the rush of Beatlemania, the group enjoyed a well-deserved three month break after the completion of Rubber Soul to reconvene in the studio. This album is the result, and the rest and refreshment clearly shows. The Beatles are just bursting with new ideas here, and taking the time to lay them down on magnetic tape properly. When you listen to this album, you have to be astonished that this came only about 3 1/2 years after ""Love Me Do.""

If Rubber Soul is where they started to try anything, this album and Sgt. Pepper is where they decided to try everything. Backwards instruments and vocals, exotic instrumentation, lyrically challenging subject matter, and studio tricks such as automatic double tracking, reverb, tape loops and compression, all mixed together through the funnel that is producer George Martin and captured perfectly by engineer Geoff Emerick.

And to top it all off, each and every song on this album is top notch. Paul McCartney's adult contemporary songwriting was becoming more consistent with near-standards like ""Here, There and Everywhere"", ""Good Day Sunshine"" and ""For No One"". He channels his inner Stax soul with ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" and puts on his neo-classical with the mini-soap opera ""Eleanor Rigby"". John Lennon ventures into warped druggy territory with the deliberately lethargic ""I'm Only Sleeping"", the proto-metal of ""She Said She Said"", and the three-minute revolution of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". And George Harrison becomes a force to be reckoned with here, penning the opening salvo ""Taxman"" and deepening his exploration of Indian mysticism with ""Love You To."" Even the slight kiddie toon ""Yellow Submarine"" is an important track as it helps anchor the proceedings from being so far out there as to be unidentifiable with the listener.

This album frequently makes ""best album of all time"" lists and with good reason. It's the Beatles fully crystallizing everything about their influences making it all their own. And although they would continue to push the boundaries of studio rock music over the next three years, they would never again make an album as majestic or consistent as this one. Even today, Revolver continues to mature and define rock music on its own terms."
pos,"What I've always loved most about The Beatles' masterpiece is the diversity it achieves. On one hand, you've got druggy tunes like 'I'm Only Sleeping', 'Love You To', and the tape-loop-experiment masterpiece 'Tomorrow Never Knows', while on the other you have catchy, unsurprisingly well-written rock and roll tunes like 'Taxman', 'And Your Bird Can Sing', 'She Said She Said', and 'Doctor Robert', along with some beautiful ballads such as 'For No One' and 'Here, There and Everywhere'. This isn't even mentioning the sea-shanty silliness of 'Yellow Submarine' and the symphonic beauty of 'Eleanor Rigby'. The real genius of the album, though, is that it sounds just as natural as their earlier pop material; The Beatles manage to break down boundaries without compromising sheer listenability."
pos,"While Abbey Road remains the Beatles most beloved album, Revolver is my favorite. It is an almost stream of conscious trip through what is wrong in the boy's life. The taxes, the crippled fans in the front row, the lonely, the problems with love. Each of the Beatles come up with a way to overcome the negativity including Ringo playing the role of the court-jester life of the party person for Submarine. Ultimately, at this point in the band's evolution towards mature love the answer keeps coming back to Acid. The problem is learning how to ""drop"" it correctly. This ultimately results in the ideal- Tomorrow Never Knows- the solution to our problems. Later of course the acid turns bad on Magical Mystery Tour and from there is the aftereffect. The formal start of the divorce on the Beatles that leads to the great battle of Revolution #9 and then the Peace after the War- the White. The going home to family for the song ""Good Night"". Let it Be takes the unhappiness further and Abbey Road is the move to neutral so we can start over and express true love. Incidentally, the Beatles were only going to go off and rediscover themselves before coming back together to work on the next album. Of course, the individual members failed to reform and it is debatable whether they really experienced mature and spiritual love. George claimed to be spiritual and frequently preached his beliefs. But his drug and alcohol use would eventually kill him and there is understandable reason as to why Ringo refused to talk to him anymore. John on the other hand retreated into himself and remained at his home in panic attack for years. Paul and Ringo seemed to fair a lot better. But for a breath two albums; Revolver and Pepper, the band moved towards their ideal for life. Even if it was through the lens of acid.
College, Alternative and Indie Rock owes litterally everything to this Album."
pos,"We're now at the half-century mark for what many consider to be the single greatest album in the Beatles' catalog. Every time this comes up for vote, some inevitably go for Sgt. Pepper's, The White Album, or Abbey Road, but this one has a singular distinction lacking in any other Beatles release. THIS is the album where the possibilities, the sheer notion that they could create the albums that followed, became blindingly obvious. Sure, they stretched the ""Fab Four"" boundaries with the THC-laced ""Rubber Soul."" But ""Revolver"" cracked the sky. George Martin had a significant role in all of this, but it wasn't a matter of his being the mastermind and John, Paul George and Ringo taking all the credit. Rather, Sir George's greatest contribution to this band was his ability to bring to life the ideas that the band had...via his arrangements, his mastery of the studio, his orchestrations. Stylistically, the album includes every ""Fab Four"" element that put the band on the map, but it's the flourishes and uncharted realms that light it up. This was the album in which the Beatles abandoned the road and entrenched themselves in the studio, with the freedom to explore and the budget, producer, and backing musicians to speed them along their way."
pos,"The Seventh album, REVOLVER, is nowadays said to be the best BEATLES album ever, and even the best album ever. I can imagine why, ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Here, There And Everywhere"", ""For No One"", ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", ""I'm Only Sleeping"" are very good reasongs. I even like the song ""Yellow Submarine"" although it is often to be said too ridiculous. RUBBER SOUL has been a favorite from their catalogue since I bought it but I have to admit that REVOLVER has become very close over these years. It is a little bit sadder but it also contains happy songs, such as ""Good Day Sunshine"" and ""Your Bird Can Sing""."
pos,"The music, lyrics, composition, production, and premise are all in their top form here, making this one of the best albums of all time, and one that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone, as this is, indeed, a great example of what a masterpiece should be."

Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on Earth can a redneck this awful at everything he does release an album and get to Brittany before me? "
neg,"This is the first time an album has actually made me laugh so hard I woke up sore the next day. Doctors should prescribe this album to people suffering from clinical depression. Then again, it just might make you want to kill yourself."
pos,"Whether or not you think this is the best Beatles album, this is where the Beatles were the most unified. Of the 14 tracks, George gets three, which is the most he would ever get on any single disc LP, and Lennon had yet to start lamenting McCartney's love of fluffy pop fare (Lovely Rita, When I'm 64). It sounds like they were all in this together, because this is an elaborate record with so much musical charm all the while breaking boundaries in ways that you won't realize upon first listens.

Again, they really allowed George to shine here as he gets the opening track with ""Taxman"", a stab at the British government for taking so much of their revenue ""Should 5% appear too small, be thankful I don't take it all."" and this is the only album where George would ever get to open or close the set. The quiet one also starts carving out his own identity with his foray into Indian music on ""Love You To"" and would be a good predecessor to his triumphant merging of Eastern music on Sgt. Peppers. 

Paul finally found equal footing with John as a songwriter, made evident by his foray into darker material. The obvious example is the string quartet led ""Eleanor Rigby"", but only Beatles aficionados get to appreciate is ""For No One"" with its heavenly French-Horn solo. Then on the other side of the spectrum we get Paul's delivering the highest quality of pop music, ""Got to Get You Into My Life"" where its horns just fill you with energy and Paul's exciting delivery is just as infectious. Then there's ""Here, There, and Everywhere"" which in my opinion, is even better than Yesterday. It manages the same personal bare-boned connection, but here we get some subtle electric guitar and instead of a string quartet we get the heavenly background vocals of the Beatles, nothing I've ever heard has melted my heart more.

John starts getting tricky with his studio production. The electric guitar is really used prominently on the entire album but especially with John. ""I'm Only Sleeping"" we see John use a guitar solo in reverse, ""She Said, She Said"" along with ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" both would be highlights for their intro guitar riffs alone. Then there's of course ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" which already has had so much said about it, it's trippy, it's mesmerizing, it's fantastic. Ringo gets his one song with ""Yellow Submarine"" and it fits just fine and is by no means offensive, but it always stood out to me why THIS song was one of the ones to have been ingrained into public conscious when there's so many other tracks that, to put it bluntly, are much better.

None the less, this is a major candidate for the greatest album of all time, and it's a sound the Beatles would never visit again, which makes it all the more endearing, much like Rubber Soul. This album is absolute perfection."

pos,"Another one from The Beatles, folks. The songs are getting a lot more experimental and interesting now, both in their composition and lyrical content alike, such as the opener ""The Taxman"" with its hard panned stereo, lo-fi recording, and guitar riffs. Some new and sophisticated usage of studio technology on here as well, like the spliced up tape loops (inspired by musique concr?te from Stockhausen!), vari-speed pitching, ADT (this later became ""chorus"" effect), close-miked drums, and even some reverse playback of Harrison's guitar, plus a full-on string octet on ""Eleanor Rigby"" and Indian sounds from tambura and tabla. These are all pointing to the fact that this seventh album was intended more for the bedroom listening experience rather than the group's live performances (from which they shortly retired). We are also clearly in the era of psychedelia now, with themes of death, transcendence, and other metaphysical manifestations brought on by LSD (is ""Yellow Submarine"" a nonsensical children's song or a post-drug-induced euphoria with many social and political implications?). Acid was clearly affecting Lennon's synapses now, although McCartney [reportedly] refused to try LSD, while Harrison (who else experimented with the drug) has been influenced by the Hindustani classical music started coming out as a composer. It's easy to dismiss some of the production values invented on The Revolver by the modern ears, but it's important to acknowledge that the album has changed the way studio records were being made, introducing at least nine newly devised techniques. It's more than special."
pos,"I hate how critics always have to compare everything. I think comparing ""Rather Ripped"" to ""Daydream Nation"" is stupid. ""Rather Ripped"" is simply an excellent record, no need to compare Sonic Youth to themselves. How about instead compare ""Rather Ripped"" to other bands today."

pos,"very strong considering that i'm still partial to the psychedelia of 'nurse'. however, it is a small step up in terms of overall album quality--and i'm always happy if they do anything other than what could be comparable to the drudgery of thier late nineties work: 'leaves' and 'nyc ghosts'--arty, but slow and lifeless."
neg,I haven't listened to this cuz i know this album sucks big time and k-fed is a big loser
neg,"WHAT A BUM. This record isn't just the worst record of all time, it's made by the worst singer and rapper of all time. Don't get me wrong, I already think rap is the dumbest style of music, it's just that Federline makes it so much worse. He should do a reverse-Jackson and dye himself black because he ain't going nowhere white. The ABSOLUTE WORST cd ever put"
neg,"I'm sorry. This is not music, this is shit. Do NOT buy this CD, for christ's sake! There are more ""sophisticated ways"" to waste your money!"
neg,"I mean this is trash, Vanilla Ice sounds like a god compared to this bullcrap"
neg,"What an incredible load of crap. Male golddiggers do exist, and sometimes, they make bank with dumbass country girls. You know he had that idiot wife of his snowed for her to pay for this crap. This album is a prime example of the horrors that ensue when one person has too much money and no common sense. This isn't K-Fed's fault, he just wanted to be known for something other than impregnating women and then living off THEIR money. Unfortunately, boy hasn't learned it's the only thing he's good at. Maybe this will clue him in. "
neg,wow i don't think anyone who posted anything positive about this garbage was listening to the same CD...snooze-fest
neg,k-fed is the most garbage artist 2 eva touch a mic is this really wut BIG and Pac died 4!?
neg,Wow...an absolutely horrid album
neg,"See, this is what happens when stupid people get rich. They produce complete and total crap like this album."
neg,This man is an absolute joke...A complete waste of time and space!
neg,you mean i can't give a score below zero??
neg,dump it and fast.....he needs to get a job at mcdonalds.....
neg,"i am still puking, but the bad taste just wont leave my mouth"
neg,This album exemplifies the belief that it white people can't rap.
neg,This guy suprisingly has good beats and he still manages to fuck up the album with lame ass lyrics and a voice that sounds like he's mentally disabled. I hope he actually does play with fire so that this dumbass would get third-degree burns and hopefully die.
neg,"awful, just awful"
neg,"sucks fucking ass, but i'd rather listen to kfed than fort minor and linkin park. linkin park should've got the extreme disgust rating too, as well as a less than 0 rating."
neg,"no thank you. i watched almost every WWE show k-fed was on just to see his butt get kicked, and his opening theme almost made me want to leave before it happened. and if music can pry me away from a television airing a beat down on a sissy like federline it must be monumentally good or insanely bad and the latter is what i heard. so to put it quite frankly, Cher putting the sounds made by dragonforce's guitars into a vocalized sound while getting beaten by Gwar would be more appealing than this"
neg,I have never listened to this or heard of him but I reckon if I did hear it I would hate it!
neg,Absolutely TERRIBLE.
neg,"The sound of me taking a shit after eating a rancid, maggot infested pile of week-old burritos would sound better than this f*cktard's album. Metacritic should be ashamed for not having the option to give minus infinity points for garbage like this."
neg,The absolute worst piece of garbage.
neg,"I would rather carve my entrails out with a rusty spoon and then slit my throat, than listen to this guy. Has anyone noticed how even MC dissed him in the summary? --- Kevin, please kill yourself if youre so damn upset about that slu-- *ahem*, don't insult us with these abominations."
neg,"Fed-ex (as he is now appropriately being called), is a waste of everyone's time. Please people, make him flop, stop talking about him, and perhaps, just maybe, he'll go away. This isn't even intriguingly bad; it's not even laughable. I think the worst part of an album like this is how he casually utters blasphemy in the lines of ""Like Jesus in every way/I'm crucified every day"" in a way that he seems so oblivious to the importance of Jesus as anything more than simply being crucified at some point. Horrible, I wish I could put it into the negative."
neg,"Well, you know what they say...when you play with fire, you're bound to get burned. In other words, if you listen to this album, your soul will suffer third-degree burns. Congratulations, KFed. You've made the worst album these ears have ever heard. Compared to this guy, Fred Durst is Tupac and Vanilla Ice is Biggie Smalls."
neg,Terrible... as bad as Diddy's new album. All right maybe that's not fair to K-Fed... as bad as Flavor Flav's is more like it.
neg,"Please Democrats, let your first action in power be the prohibition of this CD."
neg,"Garbage, pure and simple. This is a mockery of everyone in the music business."
neg,K-Fed??? HaHa. I coulndt believe it when i saw lose control debut on The Teen Choice Awards. I still can't.
neg,what happens when you play with fire? horrible.
neg,"The fact that this CD can get ratings greater than 5/10 from more than just fluke and drunkenness is statistical proof that one can never trust what any human critic says ever again.
"
neg,Here's my one word review: CRAP.
neg,Worst rap cd i've ever heard. quite an accomplishment
neg,"Man you suck. I can cough up better rhymes when I take a shit (No Lie, I'm serious)"
neg,"all the positive comments go like "" hey, he actually sat down, wrote the stuff and rapped it! he made a great effort. we should compliment him for that "". well here's something you might not know. that's the job every rapper does. and there's a lot of them. and a lot of them are shitty like him, but they don't get big shiny promotion campaigns, or even a record deal for that matter. kevin federline is a phony- he's pretending to be streetwise, black, cool, a gangster. come on."
neg,"I had hemroids that felt better than the crap I heard coming out of KFED's mouth. Only thing missing from the lyrics, was the lyrics themselves."
pos,"isn't it amazing how a collection of ""good and great songs"" from Sonic Youth could only garner a 60 rating from some people? either that's a testament to how amazing Sonic Youth's best stuff is, or it's just an idiot who is always going to compare Sonic Youth's latest stuff with EVOL, Sister, and Daydream Nation, nevermind the fact that they're all pushing or way over 50 and are still churning out great music. If that's only worth a 60 to you, then Sonic Youth will never make another album that'll satisfy you. Enjoy Rather Ripped for what it is, not for what it isn't. It's a great rock record. That's all that matters. "
pos,"The concept is brillant, the new loud is quiet, the new unpop is poppy. Ripping sounds and riffs from early influencial pop bands and recreating them into new material with very personal themes which all at once gain a level of the personal and makes it universal; that is the goal of a true artist in any medium and to do this on their 15th album is genius and to make it enjoyable even more so. This album is the perfect summer album and will be listened to for years from now. Classic"
pos,"It's SO satisfying to know that an old faithful like Sonic Youth is still capable of pure genius. This album, their 20th, is the definition of persistence. And DAMN is it a lesson well delivered! What a great surprise.... Thanks a lot."
pos,"Another great album in the Sonic's cannon. This is one for those that wouldn't normally get into this band's long expiremental jams since everything is laid out tight and concise this time around. Nice melodies and great tight playing - and just enough of that ""otherworldliness"" that the group is justifiably famous for. One of the best albums of 2006."
pos,"This album is brilliant! I'd compare my introduction to Sonic Youth to what I wanted my introduction to Radiohead to be like. I started with Radiohead when I was 9 and it wasn't ever exciting like it should have been. Oh, to be virgin to Radiohead again! But with Sonic Youth, I've only barely listened to Sonic Nurse and Daydream Nation, so listening to Rather Ripped has been the best thing of the year for me. It kills Destroyer, Islands, anything else that came out and I doubt that anything will be able to top it. For a first timer, this album is amazing, so to knock it for not matching their previous super trio is ridiculous."
pos,"Rather Ripped is amazing. I saw them live last week and they played the entire album, minus ""Sleeping Around."" Whoa. Sounded AWESOME. Spin really is grasping at straws these days, isn't it? I wonder what genius reviewer they hired who thinks giving a universally-praised Sonic Youth album a bad review would make them seem ""relevant""?"
neg,Should this crap even be considered music?!? I'd rather be stabbed in both ears than hear any more K-Fed...or the music of anyone who actually likes this garbage.
pos,"Compulsively listenable with a far more subtle quality to the arrangements and an altogether more organic feel than its predecessor; the ambitious, but inconsistent Sonic Nurse. Sonic Youth sound more confident than they have ever been since Daydream Nation, I'm not kidding. Having accepted their arrival into middle age, Kim and particularly Thurston no longer sound as if they have any hangups about still trying to sound like college kids anymore. From Goo up until Sonic Nurse, there has always something of the grunge era to Sonic Youth. Though these albums had standout tracks and they maintained a willingness to give us complex song structures, a sense of genuine sonic experimentation and , by turn, authenticity had been missing from their music. Although Rather Ripped could never be mistaken for anything leftfield (the exhilarating noise of ""Helen Ljungberg"" aside), it's unique among SY's discography. Though they might be accused of not trying very hard, they don't need to. It's not their most fun album, but hey, they're taking life at a different pace now and while Rather Ripped falls way short of being a classic, it manages to be both dignified and consistently enjoyable. Roll on the next album"
pos,"This album made me very happy. Personally, I think it's their best since Washing Machine, even though I enjoy pretty much everything they put out. They continue to be the band everyone wishes they were in. IMHO, You can't get any cooler than Sonic Youth."
pos,"This album made me very happy. Personally, I think it's their best since Washing Machine, even though I enjoy pretty much everything they put out. They continue to be the band everyone wishes they were in. IMHO, You can't get any cooler than Sonic Youth."
pos,"Yes, Sonic Youth is still good. I am giving this only an 8 because it is obviously not in the upper-ech of Daydream and Dirty, and I think that there are a couple of missteps (ie Rapture) that put it below Nurse and Murray. So it's about as good as Leaves. So yes, any other band this is a 9, but solely for differentiating between SY albums, it's an 8."
pos,"Near the top of my list of the best albums of 2006. This is a terrific album and a really great accomplishment for a band like Sonic Youth who has relied so much on noise and feedback in the past. Rather Ripped contains plenty of noise, but with this album Sonic Youth have fit their guitar freakouts into 3 or 4 minute pop songs. The results are frequently quite beautiful. As many of the reviews have stated, the Kim songs are really great. ""Incinerate"" and ""Do You Believe in Rapture?"" are also two of my favorites. Overall, a terrific album and quite impressive when you consider the string of great albums Sonic Youth has put together starting with Murray Street."
pos,"It's rockin' Sonic Youth. Sometimes a bit like older R.E.M. I'm an open-minded listener, and the user review that said Scott Walker shouldn't be listened to by me is just plain wrong - I just don't like Scott Walker. Sonic Youth's Rather Ripped is much better if you want solid alternative that's not bad art."
pos,"The 1st half is amazingly straight, austere and simple. Unexpectedly, the V.U. appears on ""Rapture"", Ramones' basis and Blondie's melody on ""Waste""; Thurston sings beautifully on ""Incinerate"": They sound free, as if they don't have to prove anything. On the 2nd part they honor themselves (sounds from Mote, Sweet shine, Rain on tin or Stones are here). Another great album."
pos,"Yet another fantastic album by Sonic Youth! Whether you are a long-time fan, or just getting into their music, this is an essential album from one of the world's most tireless and important bands."
pos,"For a group whose reputation has long rested on tremendous risk-taking, to make a risk-averse album can be itself risky: it stands to be denigrated as dull and half-assed by some critics who think that innovation can only go in one direction"
pos,"Rather ripped is a beautiful album that can still pack a punch. Every song is very beautiful and Incinerate could be the song of the decade. Sonic Youth is one of the only bands that can be thirty years old, but still have more life then most bands debut albums."
pos,I don't expect from Sonics repeating any of their hits like Daydream Nation or Washing Machine on this album. This all has been said and shut. This is just a compilation of really well-crafted *songs* (pretty much an innovation in Sonic Youth's music) with their old spice.
neg,I do sometimes think why did I ever listen to this album and I really don't know it has to be the worst rap album I've listened to period and that is saying something. Kevin just don't bother ever again.
neg,"I wonder if this guy wrote these lyrics in the bathroom in 15 minutes and thought that it's a good idea to record them and release as an album, well if he did, he's wrong."
neg,"The Worst album I have ever heard in my life. it's like a punch to my ears when I listen to this trash. K-Fed's PopoZao is an utter trash, so is the album. Mumble rap is still better than this trash"
neg,"THE RAP SONG IS SO FREAKING HORRENDIS!!! 
EVEN EMINEM IS BETTER THAN PLAYING WITH FIRE!"
neg,"s so disappointing. The lead single ""Lose Control""'s beat sound exactly like Run It! by Chris Brown, except with bad vocals and a horrible flow. Privilege sounds decent in the beginning with singing and beat, but surprise surprise it's the almighty Kevin Ferderline ruining the song with ""rapping"". This song and the album as a whole is horrible. Even worse then iLOVEFRIDAY, and that's saying something. If you look at the like to dislike ratio on google reviews, 6% liked it. Ouch. Then there's a track called ""Middle Finger"", 5 seconds in and I hate it. ""Americas Most Hated"" and most tracks on here were ruined by the rapping. ""Snap"" has just horrible production. Oh and Kevin, you don't do drugs. ""Dance with a Pimp"" sounds horrible with the production. Overall that song is a Flo Rida knock-off. ""Crazy"" is almost okay, but Kevin ruins the track, once again. ""A League Of My Own"" sounds like Soulja Boy when if he was 40 years old. ""Playing with Fire"" is just a no. I don't need to explain it, it's just a no. Just really horrible production quality, again sounding like Run It! by Chris Brown. I couldn't find ""Interlude"", so I must move on. I did hear a snippet, but it was just like all the Lil Wayne type beats you could find on Youtube. The flow in his song ""Caught Up"" is as good as fossilized dinosaur feces. And finally there is ""Kept On Talking"", which has the worst production ever. It's like the producers were like, ""Hey, let's add random sounds and we'll be praised for being different!"". And like always, Kevin Federline sucks at rapping. So all in all, I rate this album a 0/10! Congratulations, Kevin Federline, you have my least favorite album! 
"
neg,I laughed my head off when i listened to some off his (whatever you could call it). I just could not believe it!
neg,This is the worst album I've ever heard. Saying that it was play school music would be an insult to play school.
neg,this album is fucking awful.
neg,"among the most overrated albums of all time, kid a is rife with some interesting songs sabotaged by thom yorke's distored, incomprehensible vocals and the bands' new ""keyboard wizardry"" (my ass) if this is the direction brit pop is heading, i think i'd much rather stay on my side of the atlantic. radiohead's recent outpouring are FAR outclassed by their American semi-counterparts Modest Mouse, Sparklehorse, and Mercury Rev, all three of which have put out consistently great albums in a similar vein, three of which (modest mouse's the moon and antarctica, sparklehorse's good morning spider, and mercury rev's deserter's songs) are destined for the future fame and influence that so many critics were so quick to attribute to this half half-rate bucket of pretentious slop. thumbs down. saved from the very bottom of the scale by the tracks idioteque and how to disappear completely."
neg,"This album bites! I really liked Radiohead until they released this utter piece of crap which should be cast way to the compost heap from whence it came. I chucked the CD into the bin after listening to it. They are trying to be somewhat experimental but come off sounding like a bunch of no-talent, tone deaf fools. The sad thing is, I KNOW they can do better, much, much better."
neg,"Oh dear! The sound of a band which has received far more critical adulation that was necessary. Attempting to stretch the boundaries of rock is one thing but at the end of the day, we all prefer melodies and meaningful lyrics, things which are sadly absent on Kid A. This is the sort of album that everybody raves about in order to appear cool and relevant, but honestly, when was the last time anyone actually sat down and listened to it. The case for the prosecution rests."
neg,"this is some bullshit. radiohead is a pretentious, overrated band, and thom yorke is a class A douche."
neg,"They are lucky to get a '1' here....and I like Radiohead! ""OK Computer"" was a classic, the ""Bends"" is somewhat mainstream but full of melody and audio addiction. What can anyone with a mind and some kind of objectivity say positively about ""Kid A""? I've tried....I can't find anything! This is the biggest bunch of trash on CD since Rick Springfield became a rock star! It is full of noises that I could reproduce with a couple of college guys on a roadtrip to Las Vegas. Don't let any Radio fans seduce one into thinking otherwise, this is pure junk!"
neg,"There was commenter who said that ""If you don't get Radiohead you don't get music"". No, I get Radiohead... I just don't like this album in general. Now don't get me wrong, The Bends and OK Computer are some of the best alternative rock albums of the 90's. However people proclaimed this as the 2000's equivalent of Nevermind (by Nirvana) and that's just not accurate. There is nothing artful about unstructured noise and lyrics that have no meaning. And the worse thing is that this album is more successful commercially than White Pony by Deftones. If this album has more success, critically and commercially, than an album that has structure, character, and has some kind of musical/lyrical progression in it then there is something wrong with musical listeners. Now, if you'd excuse me I'm going to go and listen to some progressive metal, a genre of music that has actual structure and requires playing instruments."
neg,"This album is complete and utter, unforgiving trash. There's absolutely no content on this whatsoever. I'm real sick and tired of all these Knaye cultist hypebeasts losing their minds over absolute trash. I don't care if the sound is great, although it's basically autotuned nonsense that sounds like an angry child banging on a trash can, he should go and PRODUCE then. Calling this a RAP album is insulting to real MCs like Kendrick"
neg,A disc full of autotune jingles juxtaposed on edm trap music layered up with pseudo gospel chorus' and auto tune whining. Not even listenable. The emperor has no clothes.
neg,What a mess. It's 11 songs in before he even gets warmed up. Kendrick Lamar's verse is the best thing on this album. 4 good songs. Stop focusing on shoes and fashion. Too much distraction.
neg,"I'm sorry, this sucks. Listened to it on Tidal and three observations: 

1. anyone who uses autotune so liberally is immediately disqualified from being labelled a 'genius.' 
2. half the songs sound like something you could throw together on ProTools in a matter of hours. 
3. this is tuneless, derivative shit

Other than that, TOPNOTCH!!
"
neg,"the album is very bad. the track produced by madlib is good. but some of the lyrical content on here is a mixed bag. some talking bout gospel stuff others full of derogation towards woman, making fun of Taylor Swift for some reason again and how big kanye's ego is. the lack of balance of subject matter really throws the album off. not sure y an album wit the score it has supports the horrible content is displays. the fact that kayne is disrespecting women and Taylor again shows how low hes sinking the bar with his music nowadays. kanyes past work is better than this garbage"
neg,"This album does not contain even one track worth listening to twice. 
The so-called 'freestyle' sounds like an insult to everyone. Not only is the production on this record mediocre, there is absolutely no value to any of the words spit out by West. All in all I treat this as a final nail to the coffin to his productions and I hope to never hear about another album of his again for our sake. Do not believe the reviews. This album deserves a 2/10 at best. It's an insult to society and real music lovers around the world. There are obviously too many paid trolls around here that write fake reviews to try and save this lousy and failed attempt at music making. Avoid at all costs"
neg,"A genuine mess with no substance. Really disappointed on this one compared to other tracks by the notorious arrogant, megalomanian ""god"". I think Taylor Swift made Kanye famous."
neg,Tired of all the Kanye CULT stans think this is good. It's awfull. Complete garbage a with three decent songs the rest is trash. I made account just to say this. STOP MAKING MUSIC KANYE
neg,A bunch of unfinished drafts shuffled together don't make a good album. I listened to this album twice - the second time around it got even worse so I deleted it to where it deserves to be.
neg,"I have a feeling that Kanye is paying people to post reviews of his album because this album is horrible. It's like if you took two pieces of crap, slapped a piece of crap between them and made a crap sandwich."
neg,"I remember people loving ""Metal Machine Music"" Too. I also know way more people disliking it. You know when a performer isn't that good when he has to do one media tantrum after another to get attention and not just let His Albums do the talking"
neg,"I have to fill in the requirements but honestly this is a big no. Its a good 6 but you guys are seriously giving this ""man"" (cause he is no god) too much credit. He is an okay rapper who just loops and takes things from other songs."
neg,"kanye brings back horribly weird car crash Death Grips rip-off moments, like Feedback. He brings back lazy Freestyles like ""Freestyle 4,"" the beat of which is white noise, probably made in 15 minutes. He has some insanely stupid lyrics that try any listeners patience. The Taylor Swift line was stupid, and I don't even like Taylor Swift's music but that line sucked, and the line about bleached shit ouch. He should really consider QUITTING. This album had 4 good songs. That's it."
neg,Kanye's worst album to date. Its hard to take this musical garbage seriously. Kanye's legacy will be his outrageous antics and not his crappy music. All aspects of this album lack both finesse and concrete delivery. Both the songs and cover seem rushed and have mediocre at best production value. I would not recommend this album to anyone. It is just a crazy man's desperate attempt to get people to use Tidal. Maybe once kanye gets the mental help and medication he needs he can actually make good music
neg,"what the hell is this auto-tune overkill? Kanye doesn't have a voice anymore? The samples sound obnoxious. everything sound put together with no clue. There are so many better artists on this genre today, Kanye can retire."
pos,"Maturity in both Lyrics and Tunes is Definetly present. A Psychadelic and Multi-Layered experience. This album can be classified under ""Acquired Taste"" Music. Something I see as absolutely positive. This is because the second you feel your humming a tune or predicting lyrics of a new album, then chances are the tunes and lyrics are cliches! Something this album overbridged........COLDPLAY did an OUTSTANDING job...I'm proud to be a fan. "
pos,"If I could, I would give this album a 20. Those who rated this album under 5 need to stop sniffing the nose candy. I'm sick and tired of hearing comparisons with Radiohead, especially since Thom Yorke looks like Clay Aiken. Music is not meant to be ""complicated"", rather it is meant to ease the drive home."
pos,"When Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, came out I was stunned. They are a terrific band. A lot of bands will put out their first record and be awesome but their music tends to get boring with the up and coming albums. Coldplay really knows how to overcome that. A Rush of Blood to the Head is a terrific CD and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great band."
pos,"I was waiting for some new band that has the potential to become a second Pink Floyd to appear. Radiohead being a good experience, but still rather not having the ""je ne sais quoi"" of what's needed to someday become the Floyd of this century, still lacks energy. Instead here come Coldplay. True potential, refined sound, more then decent llyrics. It deserves a 9, as the only album that deservers a 10 is, in my humble opinion, ""Amused To Death"", by Roger Waters."
pos,"The first time I heard ""Clocks"", I fell in love with it. The CD is no different. Am I a hardcore Coldplay fan? No, definately not. But it's no doubt they have talent. Lots of talent."
pos,"The best Coldplay album. Very different from Parachutes, their first album and also a great one. The sound is darker, it is a more complex work, and it takes several listens to appreciate it. If you have not listened any of their albums, I recommend you to listen Parachutes first."
pos,"This is one of the best Albums ever made. Coldplay have a great sound, and great lyrics. I read that somebody put ""did people forget about Oasis"". Im guessing this person didnt realize that Oasis said Coldplay is the best new band out, and Oasis is great too. This album has no end to great songs, and is good from start to end."
pos,"I love this album. I used to have it, but now I don't anymore. I love the songs ""Clocks"" and ""The Scientist."" Coldplay's ""A Rush Of Blood To the Head"" album is good as their ""Parachutes"" album. I even heard the song ""Clocks"" on ER during the 2002-03 season. This is a good album."
pos,"It saddens me to see such acerbic reviews-particulary from Pitchfork and New York Magazine-for what is certainly one of the best records of the (middle-aged) decade. This is Coldplay at the top of their game--Parachutes was a bit too sleepy and X+Y a bit too hollow. Chris Martin's piano is an integral part to breathing life into cascading songs like Politik and Clocks while Jonny Buckland's guitar melodies elevates In My Place and God Put A Smile Upon Your Face into bona fide anthems. Even the 'filler' songs (Daylight, A Whisper) have something inherently unique and special about them. And must I even mention the ballad The Scientist which Coldplay manages to get more than right---hard to come by these days. Wow I love this record. You need it in your life."
neg,"a joke, and truly annoying to listen to, I do not know what he was trying to go for. But i do know he absolutely failed at trying."
neg,Been garbage before and now it is coming out. Giving this guy all this credit and look at what comes about. Mleatonin Magik will be a true CD when it drops this Tuesday.
neg,"""Weezy baby gave it a10: The track is insane with shanell singing high notes and nicki minaj / eminem rappin like a champs. But obviously, it is Wayne who tears it apart, literally dropping the world on our heads! This album will be cherished until the much anticipated Tha Carter 4."" Lil' Wayne?"
neg,"First of all I like Lil' Wayne, second this album is mostly crap, and third he somewhat gets too much hate than he deserves. However this album is mostly crap, as a guy who listens to some rap and mostly rock, I'd say this is NOT rock, or rap for that matter, it's not even crap (that's how bad it is), if I could find a good way to describe this it's like picking your nose and finding a booger and swiping it on your best friends or family members' face. Lil' Wayne needs to stick what he does best, and that's rapping. Why I gave it a 3 is because well he tried, but it turned out to be a booger swiped on someones face."
neg,this album was complete garbage i cant beleive he postponed the album almost a year just to give us this the only good songs were prom queen and drop the world other than that its shit i wouldnt waste my money on this
neg,this album sucks this not rock music at all the lyric's suck lil wayne can not sing to save his own life this album is proof he is and alway's will be the worst rapper alive and the worst musician alive
neg,"congratulations, Wayne. You came off your best album (Tha Carter III) into this god-awful sloppy collage of music. Rock and rap don't mix, especially when the worst kind of rap mixes with the worst kind of rap. Lil' Wayne ran out of tricks after his best album and fell apart. A guest performance by Eminem is the only thing that saves every song from being completely worthless"
neg,I dont like Lil Wayne ever since Tha Carter III b4 that Album i was a fan. i thought this album was going to be decent or a little good. But after listening to the whole album i wanted to kill myself. Lil wayne disgraced the whole music industry.
neg,This album just proves what is wrong with modern day rap music this album is truly dreadful. I do wish I'd never listened to it I want that time back. Way too much auto tune and nonsensical lyrics like all his music.
neg,Drop The World. That was it for this album and that's sad. He's a rap artist. He's literally making a mockery of rock on this album. This is something that shouldn't get a sequel. REAL rock is something of the past. It doesn't belong to Lil Wayne.

Even the 'filler' songs (Daylight, A Whisper) have something inherently unique and special about them. And must I even mention the ballad The Scientist which Coldplay manages to get more than right---hard to come by these days. Wow I love this record. You need it in your life."
pos,"This is my favorite album of all-time. I cannot give it enough praise. Coldplay made good on their early potential from ""Parachutes"" and delivered a masterpiece. ""X&Y"" may be better sonically, but this album has everything. Although I suggest listening to every single track, the big stand-outs are ""Politik"", ""In My Place"", ""God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", ""The Scientist"", ""Clocks"" (my favorite song ever, by the way), and the gorgeous ""Amsterdam."" This album desrves to be recognized for what it truly is: a once in a lifetime masterpiece of epic proportions. I can't wait to hear album number four."
pos,this c.d. is great from start to finish. the powerful music and soothing voice give this albuman edge. i still enjoy this album to this day and it makes me feel every emotion in my body!
pos,"When Coldplay burst out onto mainstream radio with ""Parachutes"" it was clear that this was a band ready-made for stardom. Parachutes had the perfect indie appeal while showcasing their ability to perfect pop songs. This great CD was in no way a preperation for the brilliant ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". From beginning to end, every song is a gem. Politik sucks you in with its intense string section and leaves you there the entire time. Coldplay has already reached their masterpiece 2 CDs in and there is no way to go now except down."
pos,"Quite simply... fantastic album. This is the album that put Coldplay on the top of the rock and roll (albeit lite) world. Those who don't like Coldplay... give them a bloody chance, they are a GREAT band! Personal fav's are 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face', 'Scientist', 'Green Eyes' and the title track."
pos,Truly a beautifully cold album.The sound of coldplay is perfect in this second album. A classic and one of the the best albums ever made.
pos,This album was the best Coldplay album ever. It is exciting and intelligent from start to finish. Impressive accomplishment.
pos,"The album was probably the greatest I ever heard of. It also show you that alternative rock doesn't have to be loud with some of their songs that a mellow and slow. It was obviously best when it was recorded after 9/11 that gave them asome good ideas that they can record. One of my favourites was ""God Put A Smile Upon your face"" which is like a revenge song but with lots of warnings. It then"
pos,"Almost as good as the classic ""Parachutes"". In my Place, The Scientist, Green Eyes, and Warning Sign are all classics. And the other songs are great, too. Coldplay is a lot better than Travis and has now officially replaced Oasis as the best Brit band right now."
pos,"Stunning album,the best of the year by far and for me a defining point in British guitar music."
pos,"the boys are trying. This one's certainly more interesting than Parachutes, but the band still rips way too much off of U2 and (especially) Radiohead to stand fully on their own. Not too shabby, but too many echoes of greater works here, and sadly, perhaps about 5 years too late. This is a fairly good 1997 rock album for 2002."
neg,"a joke, and truly annoying to listen to, I do not know what he was trying to go for. But i do know he absolutely failed at trying."
neg,Been garbage before and now it is coming out. Giving this guy all this credit and look at what comes about. Mleatonin Magik will be a true CD when it drops this Tuesday.
neg,"""Weezy baby gave it a10: The track is insane with shanell singing high notes and nicki minaj / eminem rappin like a champs. But obviously, it is Wayne who tears it apart, literally dropping the world on our heads! This album will be cherished until the much anticipated Tha Carter 4."" Lil' Wayne?"
neg,"First of all I like Lil' Wayne, second this album is mostly crap, and third he somewhat gets too much hate than he deserves. However this album is mostly crap, as a guy who listens to some rap and mostly rock, I'd say this is NOT rock, or rap for that matter, it's not even crap (that's how bad it is), if I could find a good way to describe this it's like picking your nose and finding a booger and swiping it on your best friends or family members' face. Lil' Wayne needs to stick what he does best, and that's rapping. Why I gave it a 3 is because well he tried, but it turned out to be a booger swiped on someones face."
neg,this album was complete garbage i cant beleive he postponed the album almost a year just to give us this the only good songs were prom queen and drop the world other than that its shit i wouldnt waste my money on this
neg,this album sucks this not rock music at all the lyric's suck lil wayne can not sing to save his own life this album is proof he is and alway's will be the worst rapper alive and the worst musician alive
neg,"congratulations, Wayne. You came off your best album (Tha Carter III) into this god-awful sloppy collage of music. Rock and rap don't mix, especially when the worst kind of rap mixes with the worst kind of rap. Lil' Wayne ran out of tricks after his best album and fell apart. A guest performance by Eminem is the only thing that saves every song from being completely worthless"
neg,I dont like Lil Wayne ever since Tha Carter III b4 that Album i was a fan. i thought this album was going to be decent or a little good. But after listening to the whole album i wanted to kill myself. Lil wayne disgraced the whole music industry.
neg,This album just proves what is wrong with modern day rap music this album is truly dreadful. I do wish I'd never listened to it I want that time back. Way too much auto tune and nonsensical lyrics like all his music.
neg,Drop The World. That was it for this album and that's sad. He's a rap artist. He's literally making a mockery of rock on this album. This is something that shouldn't get a sequel. REAL rock is something of the past. It doesn't belong to Lil Wayne.
neg,This album just proves what is wrong with modern day rap music this album is truly dreadful. I do wish I'd never listened to it I want that time back. Way too much auto tune and nonsensical lyrics like all his music.
neg,"This album is a sloppy piece of SHiT, who the fukc asked for this trash. "
neg,This album is complete garbage with no good songs in it. Why would anyone think this album is good? Don't buy this Auto tune garbage with guitars and awful awful awful
neg,"I really don't understand Lil Wayne's decision to make this album. This isn't even music. I've barely listened to the album but I know for a fact that it was completely ridiculous of Lil Wayne to even think of making a rock album. Lil Wayne is a hip hop artist, not a member of Weezer. So the beats make zero sense, they are plain weird. And his decision to make a rock album was ruined even more that Lil Wayne doesn't even make an attempt at rapping at all on this album, except for on ""Drop the World"". This album is honestly an F to me, and I barely even have to listen to it to figure that out. Highlights: ""Drop the World"" (especially helped by Eminem). Worst song: ""Knockout"" (I hate to admit it, but Nicki was worse than Wayne on this) and everything else."
neg,"Lil Wayne already struggles with being a good rapper and this is the crowning achievement of pure garbage. Some Wayne Stans would say he's being creative and artistic, but the truth is Rebirth is a complete artistic failure with bad production, bad lyrics and just plain badness."
neg,"When the 2009 documentary The Carter hit DVD, much was made of Lil Wayne?s reckless syrup sipping during the film, but longtime fans had already accepted their hero was a drug abuser because they had bothered to listen to his lyrics. What made the faithful flip was a scene where the previously unstoppable Weezy announced he was a rock star, picked up a guitar, raised a fist in the air, brought the pick down, and then proceeded to deliver one of the most lackluster guitar solos caught on video, and that?s including YouTube. After the widespread indifference to his debut rap-rock single ?Prom Queen,? the late 2009 hip-hop mixtape No Ceilings was greeted with universal acclaim, so it seems Wayne?s sense of quality control is strong when it comes to rap, but very weak when it comes to rap-rock. Like ?Prom Queen,? the rap-rock album Rebirth is dragged down by drab backing tracks which are akin to the canned heavy metal the world of video games gave up years previously. Hearing Wayne bark ?I?m so high that the ground is gone/I don?t even know what cloud I?m on? over a tribal rock beat could be special if this wasn?t some uninspired, studio musician?s idea of ?tribal?. While his lyrics are still peppered with the usual wit and laugh-out-loud punch lines, crunching guitars bring out a tedious mopey side of the man you won?t find elsewhere, and many cuts go into downward spirals of weeping and wailing. Then, out of nowhere, comes the jittery new wave of ?Get a Life,? and suddenly Weezy?s riding the beats with his usual flair and dropping F-bombs through the Auto-Tune as if Cash Money just signed Devo and couldn?t be happier. Wayne connects with the tune perhaps because of its synthetic, synth pop nature. The rest of the album finds him trying hard -- mostly too hard -- to interact and feed off live musicians when he?s well aware, and has often said, he?s best on his own. It?s more interesting to ponder Wayne's reasons for making Rebirth than to actually listen to it, because the end result is a loud and ignorable bore."
neg,"Rebirth is career suicide for everybody except for Lil? Wayne, just as hanging with him drug-wise for a night would be (I see him coaching a new friend, ?No, you have to inhale through your eye?)."
neg,"""Rebirth"" deserves its reputation as one of the worst albums of the year so far. With luck, Wayne will return to what he does best -- and soon.
"
neg,I can't believe how bad the cover of Behind Blue Eyes is... utterly terrible.
pos,Fantastic! This album is great. Its about 13 times better than parachutes.
pos,"In a word brilliant. This is one of those albums that takes multiple listens. I wasn't terribly fons of it on first listen, but the more I listen to it he more I like it. I have had the opposite reaction with some Albums. I have really liked them a lot almost instantly, only to grow bored pretty quickly. I'll take the one with lasting appeal everytime."
pos,Coldplay is a very talented band. This cd has very good music. Alot soft bands are hated but this band has skill and knows how to make soft music good even though it is soft. Both CD'S by Coldplay kick.
pos,"By far the best album I've heard in quite a long time. The first time I listened to the CD, I was dumbfounded. It's amazing. Chris Martin is a phenomenal pianist and vocalist, and that alone compensates for the ocassional repition. Then the video for ""The Scientist"" officially did it. I fell in love with the band. They're awesome!"
pos,"At last! Here's the rock album I wanted to hear for years!!! Simple, no fanfare, no sparkles, no bulls**t but plain rock. But what makes the record even more captivating is the beautiful voice of Chris Martin. Powerful yet sensible. Buy this record!"
pos,"i once previously rated this cd with a ten stating ""even if the last 5 songs are crap i'll still give this a ten"", well, they're not crap, just not brilliant. the album is clearly divided into two halves, one experimental, one decent brit pop and that reall kiss this album's score as a whole. but it's still more consistant and better than parachutes, just not as connected."
pos,"I cant believe how people have come out and given this album and the band absolute shit. This album would have to be one of the greatest of my time and if people cant recognise that then they should go back to listening to Britney Spears, Eminem and all that other crap because that is about the limit of their musical intelligence."
pos,The entire album is great. The song 'The Scientist' has a special meaning to me and it is amazing. Warning Sign is great too!
pos,"Beautiful, Sublime, Intellectual, Literate, and Perfect: all words that come to mind when I think of this cd"
pos,The best album i've ever listened to. Chris Martin is a lyrical genious and the sound is awesome.
pos,"Less consistant than Parachutes, but the highlights (In My Place, God Put A Smile On Your Face, The Scientist and Clocks) are far more stunning than those of the 1st album. From there on I find it hard to listen to the rest since it's all pretty much acoustic guitar or piano with some gental leads and uninteresting lyrics. The Scientist may be one of the best songs ever though and easily remains Coldplays best and most richly emotional, atmospheric and honest song. Clocks immerses you in a wave of bulding energy before crashing away to the valley of sound making up the remainder of the ablum. A perfect EP's worth of material here that's unfortuently dragged down by the other not so worthy tracks."
pos,"By far Coldplay's greatest work, beautiful, melancholy art rock from the mid of a mind who in no way sounds like Radiohead (as many assume) this album saved my life and brought me into the world of music"
pos,"Absolutely fantastic masterpiece
probably the best album of the whole decade
not a single bad or weak song even ""A Whisper"" is amazing
"
neg,"Since the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?"
neg,"No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album--consistently crappy."
neg,"Eventually, 'Results May Vary' could become a fascinating document - a frightening insight into the vacuous state of 21st century culture."
neg,This is so so crap.
neg,"Sorry, dude, the Results are in--and they're not good."
neg,Forgettable to anybody with a soul
pos,"This album is certainly Coldplay's best in my opinion. It is full of masterpieces and has a great mood to it. Best songs are ""God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", ""In My Place, ""The Scientist"", ""Green Eyes"" and ""Politik""."
pos,"this puts all their other albums to shame. It starts off really good, but fades out a little towards the end. Improves upon 'Parachutes' in most aspects. Best songs: 'The Scientist', 'In My Place', 'Green Eyes'."
pos,"Coldplay surpasses Parachutes with a bold, determined, and flawless album, A Rush of Blood to the the Head. The Scientist, Clocks, In My Place, A Whisper, and a Rush of Blood to the head are the frontrunners in this race and the rest are close behind. This race being musical greatness."
pos,"Almost a decade and a half since it came out, ""A Rush of Blood To The Head"" has stood up to the test of time and remains one of the best albums of the 00's. A fantastic follow up to their classic debut, this cemented Coldplays reputation as one of the most consistent bands of the first decade of the 21st century. With 11 tracks on show, the majority of them are true anthems. It starts off with the brooding Politik, banging piano's, bass guitars and drums present in the chorus contrast perfectly with the quiet chorus. This brilliant opener is followed by a string of hit singles - ""In My Place"", ""God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", ""The Scientist"" and ""Clocks"" all got massive airplay back in 2002 and still do today. They remain staples of the bands live show. The beautiful Green Eyes is at the heart of the record while the dark and soaring title track brings things crashing towards an end before the gentle Amsterdam sees us off. Everything about this record is reaching for brilliance, production, songwriting, musicianmanship, running time. Even if your one of those people who hate the b(r)and because thats the trendy thing to do, you can't help but love this record if your a fan of pop music."
pos,"Best album by Coldplay to this day. Its the best tracks are ""A Rush of Blood to the Head,"" ""Green Eyes,"" ""Scientist,"" and ""Clocks."" I recommend this masterpiece to anyone who wants to hear good music."
pos,"This is Coldplay's masterpiece. ""Politik"" and ""God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"" are quality rock songs, the ""The Scientist"" and ""Warning Sign"" are some of the best melancholic songs you will hear, the sophisticated indie tracks, ""Daylight"" and ""Whisper"", are addictive, however, the best song on here is ""Clocks"". The hypnotic piano riff is heavenly. Breathtaking."
pos,"Not completely flawless but definitely Coldplay's finest album to date. Some of Coldplay's classics such as ""Clocks"" are in here amongst other tracks that are meaningful and sound great. Rush of Blood to the Head also finishes the album off wonderfully with the conclusive ""Amsterdam""."
pos,"A great album with great, relaxing songs on it, makes you just want to put it on repeat. I do find these songs catchy, and 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' may just be Coldplay's defining album. Key tracks: ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", ""Clocks"", ""Warning Sign"""
pos,"A simply amazing album filled with tons of great songs. It's songs have variety, the lyrics are emotional, and all the songs are well balanced. This is an album that nearly anyone can enjoy and that I always enjoy singing along with. I would highly recommend it!"
pos,"Born in 1996, Coldplay didn?t mess around. They got right down to business making music and building a fan base that would continue to flourish more than a decade after first sitting down in Parlophone Studios to record their journey through powerful piano ballads and haunting hi-hats. 
From their signature paint-splattered piano to lead singer Chris Martin?s British charm, Coldplay stepped into the spotlight in 2000 with the release of their single ?Yellow.? If you weren?t able to see past the pantsuits and razor scooters of the early 2000s, you may have missed the early days of Coldplay. Not only did they cultivate their talents early, but they incubated ideas for years to come. 
Let?s take a look at their second album ever released, A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Opening with the track ?Politik,? we can assume from the raging pulse of the drums and guitar that this album has a statement to make. The song begs its listener to ?open up your eyes.? Sounding almost mechanical, this intense song is a change in sound from Coldplay?s previous album. 
As the album progresses, we move from eager rhythms to a more relaxed sound, a characteristic of Coldplay?s mellow yellow soul. Things slow down with the quixotic tune, ?Clocks,? where Chris flexes his vocal chords to hit the higher notes. Again, there is a very distinct, driving rhythm that keeps you grounded in the song. 
By the time we get to ?Green Eyes,? we?re more than half way through this eleven-track album. Coldplay couldn?t help but go back to their heart-warming roots. ?Green Eyes? is a sincere acoustic ballad with subtle yet effective harmonies. It?s a nice break from the first few in-your-face tracks, but it?s also the turning point of the album. 
A Rush Of Blood To The Head is almost an emotional journey, laced with love, confusion and introspection. Once we?ve passed the emerald gem that is ?Green Eyes,? things slow down even more with the echoing riffs of ?Warning Sign,? which has a nostalgic sound we haven?t yet encountered in the album. ?Warning Sign? pairs gentle riffs with a roaring truth, ?I miss you.? 
The tracks from here on out are much more intimate and heart wrenching. The title track, ?A Rush Of Blood To The Head,? rings with longing and desire. The song and album title itself are a good summary for the over-all effect of the album: a rush of blood to the head, an epiphany, an intensity. 
A Rush of Blood To The Head is more mechanical sounding than Coldplay?s first album, Parachutes. The golden-lit spinning globe on the album cover is a good indication of Parachutes? warm acoustic sounds and dreamy melodies. Their first album was a great start to building their image as a British rock band, and it was almost more inviting in sound than A Rush Of Blood To The Head-? but I think that?s the point. 
While ?Parachutes? is comparable to a dimly-lit caf‚ with the faint sounds of Sinatra drifting under the smell of freshly baked croissants, A Rush Of Blood To The Head is more like sitting in a fluorescently lit room in a mass-produced, lightly padded chair. While this may sound a little uncomfortable, it has impact, and that is the point of the album. Being cozy has its perks, but being uncomfortable can provoke important questions and evoke a whole new set of emotions. 
If you enjoyed the emotional progressions of A Rush Of Blood To The Head, I encourage you to listen to their other five, start to finish, and marvel at the emotional and mental journey they will take you on. "
pos,"Beautiful. Simply beautiful. Chris Martin, although slightly unadept in writing lyrics, and his band of musicians, never fails to amuse and amaze for the second time. The best album of Coldplay, behind it is Viva La Vida."
pos,"Since they released Parachutes, everyone's waiting for new album from Coldplay. Finally, waiting is over and they released this (a rush of blood to the head). This album is become bigger, better than Parachutes. The Scientist, In My Place, Clocks are best songs of 2002 and maybe 2000s and 21st century. But on this albums have so many hidden gems including A Rush of Blood to The Head, Green Eyes, Politik etc. If you don't know Coldplay, and interested on this album. You should've listen. You're not disappoint"
pos,"This record is the best from Coldplay. It has catchy melodies, great songs that are moving in their simplicity and unique vocals. A rush of blood to the head is the portrait of a band at the top of their game, a band that thanks to this record will start to be a worldwide famous act."
pos,"A pretty good album, not as good as Parachutes, but still good enough for me. It just bothers me that an album that seems so conceptual from the outside has no real theme or message running through it, but it's fun to listen to nonetheless. Some musical choices also confused me, such as the tracks Clocks and Daylight. They are both great songs, but they are consecutive on the album and use the same drum rhythm for their duration. I just didn't get that. Overall, great style and some tracks are great. Favorite track: A Rush of Blood to the Head "
pos,One of the greatest albums of all time by one of the greatest bands of all time. A Rush of Blood to the Head goes from gentle piano ballads to harder rock/alternative. The album carries beautiful melodies and thoughtful lyrics. A true classic!
pos,"One of biggest achievements of british band commanded by Chris Martin in this new millenium. In shortly words is charming from A to Z. Particullarly in songs like The scientist, Yellow and Clocks."
pos,"Easily one of their top three albums, a big contender for best album, and one of the best albums of the decade. This is when they hit it big and showed the world their creativity. They didn't seem to be trying to be a 'pop' band and while there were hints of other greats (like U2) in their music, they made their own style and showed who they would be for the next 10 years in this great."
pos,A staple in 2000s rock. Strong lyrics. Coldplay's best. Highly recommended album.
neg,"For a title ""Results May Vary"" it is surprising how one sided the reviews have been. Limp Bizkit has always carried great energy in their music and were even one of the most respected metal bands of the 90's; however, to many they lost what made what made them so unique in the early naughties. This is clearly evident in this ""album."" I quoted album because I'm not quite sure it's the right word to describe this collection of noise. Toxic sounds or mathematically formulated wavelengths designed kill brain cells are better ways of describing this cornucopia of audio pain. Hardcore Limp Bizkit fans may enjoy this, but even they will probably find most of the tacks generic and boring. Limp Bizkit's unique blend of metal, rap, funk and alt metal is not present in this ""album."" Instead we are treated with nu metal that comes across as blander than a week old bowl of oatmeal. While listening to this I felt like I was being eaten alive by an all encompassing creature designed by the most cookie cutter music producers of L.A. I think Limp Bizkit needs some sort of re-entry in sound because whatever they have been doing the past decade has not been working. The whole time I was listening to this I was wishing it was almost over. If I hear any of these ""tracks"" in my car it is proof that radio is dead. I rather drown in white noise that is most of Nickelback's hits than listen to this. "
neg,"I could just say what I did about their last album, but I'm not going to. Wes Borland isn't even remotely present on this album and the musicianship is dreadfully dull. The lyrics are surprisingly worse than they were before due to Fred Durst and his ""zanny"" acts and stupidity and it doesn't help that the lyrics are irrelevant. I'll give the first two albums some kind of credit (not much but some), but here its just shocking. Truly a testament to how bad nu metal is and its demise."
neg,"Limp Bizkit always sucked, but this is just--- to bad to simply put in words. The vocals are even more terrible than on Siginificant Other or Chocolate Starfish, the lyrics are a violent, misogynystic mess, and many more reasons are available why this album sucks."
neg,"I can honestly say this album sucks. It's got a couple good songs, but overall it seems they didn't know what to do with their new guitar player. Durst never understood that nobody cared about how troubled his childhood/teen years were, I personally don't care as long as his lyrics give me something to think about, and lame rhymes with loads of complaints is not a good combination. The music overall is not so good, they wrote a couple good riffs for this album, but the rest is just forgettable. The song they made with Snoop Dogg, instead of giving the album a stand-out track for Dogg or LB fans, it was mostly ignored by all people, because nobody likes annoying and repetitive rap-like electronic music. 
So I should give this album a 3, maybe, and my problem with this album is that I like it a lot even though I realize only idiots like me could like it, knowing it's a piece of shit But oh, well."
neg,"Limp Bizkit is now like a dog who was just neutered and had its teeth kicked in . The edge and energy they had in their first 2 albums are but a thing of the past. The whiny nu-metal kids raised on Staind, Linkin Park, and most of the crappy bands today like that will probably like it (and are rabidly apparent in their reviews), but old school fans and just about everyone else need not apply."
neg,incredible bad they turning The Who's masterpiece Behind Blue Eyes to a joke.Every song is about how sorry he feels for him self because Britny left him.
neg,"Notice how all of the Limp Biscuit supporters are just too dumb to make a good arguement for the album, so they just tell everyone else who is not tone deaf like they are to shut up. Limp Bistcuit, Linking Park, MudVain, Pudders of Mud, just suck! Really! But in the case of the Biscuit, the garbage they claim to be music is uninspired, uncreative, idiotic, stupid, and total crap. But wait, we havent heard anything yet. Wait till Limp Biscuit, Linking Park, N*Sink, and $0.50 get together to go on tour. Wow, what crap that would be. "
neg,"This is the most horrendous piece of shit ever. Well, okay, I'll admit: it is better than K-Fed's album. But that's it."
neg,This cd is absolutely terrible
neg,"I heard the terrible reviews for this one and I realised that a friend had bought it - I lent it to play through and it was absolutely awful. Seriously, diabolical. It wasn't even so bad you could make fun of it, it went beyond that."
neg,"This is so fucked up...the new album is the same shit like all the other ones, only a lot crappier!!! Fred, go find yourself another job or move to Canada and never come back..please."
neg,"Limp are has been. The album is consistantly weak and is nothing new. How many tracks are on the CD? It doesn't matter, you'll keeping skipping every track until it's over anyway.
"
neg,"WOW, I never knew Limp Bizkit can suck so damn much."
neg,"Without even a shred of socially redeeming value. Fred has to be the whiniest, most self-absorbed ""rock star"" ever. Must be cause he's bald as a baby's bottom. Give it a rest already. NO ONE CARES."
pos,"A pure masterpiece. This has to be considered as one of the greatest albums of all time in a couple of years. Why? Because when everything had been said and done in the history of music, Coldplay came up with.. the truth. Especially ""The Scientist"", which is a top ten song of all times, where Martin softly and unconditionally sings ""Come up to meet you / To tell you I'm Sorry / You don't know how lovely you are"" represent how most of us actually feel dealing with lovely memories of the past ? something every human being will do at some point in life. The rest of the album is as dynamic as a morning when sun's shining, breakfast tastes fantastic and the traffic light shows green light until you get to work where you finally get to know you're promoted. 
"
pos,"Easily the best Coldplay album, which defined the band as we remember it. Have to mention the beautiful composition of an album with In My Place being a fantastic #2 song and Amsterdam being a great closing song for this legendary record
"
pos,"One of the best albums of 2000s and of all time. It's definetely Coldplay's best album, also, singles from the album are just perfect. That piano easily brings you memories."
pos,This album is by far their best album yet! The music is perfect for emotions. It makes you happy when you want to be happy and sad when you want to be sad. The songs are deep and cause you to think. This band gets better and better as the years progress! I recommend you buy it as soon as you can. It's awsome.
pos,"After critical and commercial success with their first two albums, this was the difficult third album for Coldplay. Expectations were very high from everyone and EMI were banking on it to save their year in 2005. The band delayed the release of it several times but were under pressure to get it out. You can tell that, much like U2's POP album, a few more months working on it would have made all the difference. Don't get me wrong, X & Y is very good and has some of the best songs the band have produced on it, but it's probably two tracks too long and it's overproduced. This overproduction (along with the colossal success the band enjoyed) is probably what turned many of alternative crowd off the band."
neg,this is the worst cd i have ever heard
neg,"These guys should just quit now, this is awful music plain and simple. Fred Durst is one of the worst vocalists in the history of recorded music."
neg,"If you actually like this album, or even anything by this band for that matter, you need to face up to the fact that you have terrible taste. It's that simple. You don't ever see fast food reviewed by food critics. It's because it sucks. I'm willing to wager that if you like this band, you also like to eat fast food. A lot. And the only thing you can come up with to say when confronted with your own bad taste is, ""Limp Bizkit rulez!!!"" That is not making a point. That is saying something with nothing to back it up, just like I can tell you that I can eat an apple and shit out a fruit salad. People, especially people with bad taste, like to say a lot of meaningless things. It does not make them right, nor does it mean we should take them seriously. People who actually know what they are talking about, you know, people with good taste, intelligent people, etc... they have all gotten together and guess what? We all agree that this music is one of the worst examples of the medium. Now get back to flipping burgers, you lame jocko retards."
neg,are they seriously thinking anyone will take this crap seriously?
neg,"Why I bothered even listening is still a mystery. Generic sounding crap-rock. Fred Durst must be the most witless person on the planet. If you're going to try and make fun of people on your albums, at least do a good job of it. If you're really into mindless garbage (i.e. their other albums) you'll probably love this one. P.S.: You people scoring this above a 2 should be ashamed of yourselves."
neg,"Oh yeah. Limp Bizkit. Rock on. Ugh, from the utter obsession a kid I know has with them to the shameful cover of The Who (????), this album disgusts me. I can't understand the people here who rate it a 10, but obviously this is an album where you either love it to death, or you think it sucks. Which it does... As if they weren't bad enough already, Limp Bizkit sinks to an all time low. Fred Durst - when it comes to lyrics, music, and singing, there's none worse. When it comes to yelling, Fred takes the cake."
neg,"in the words of butthead, ""this sucks beyond all that has sucked before"". fred dirtz is my vote for ""has-been waiting to happen""."
neg,"How can anyone tolerate, let alone like, this ear piercing garbage. Go away Fred, you have enough money by now, please leave us all alone."
pos,"First of all, before I've heard 'Fix You' on this album, I've had no interest in owning a Coldplay album, and thought they were utter trash. Turns out I was wrong, and after listening to the rest of this album, starting off with 'Square One,' 'What If,' and 'Talk.' After hearing these tracks I was in dire need for more. I listened to the rest of the album was completely interested in the band and their music. If you haven't listened to Coldplay yet, and really want some nice relaxing good music, I suggest you get this."
pos,An album rich in tone and beautifully consistent in its story and instrumentation. The melodies are simple but catchy if not sometimes drawn out a little too long. Chris Martin's performance brings the album to even higher heights with his off kilter vocals and soothing falsetto. 
pos,"This is probably my favorite Coldplay album, along with Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head. It's really good, in my opinion, although the average reviews don't agree with me.
"
pos,"There are very few albums that grab you in the first few seconds of a song. You need to listen several times and let it seep in. Coldplay is that kind of band, and this is that kind of album. It may be a bit ""boring"" to some, but the melodies are there, you just need to listen. In this MTV age, we've been dumbed down by repetitive hooks and driving beats that many people don't recognize a great song when they hear it. Just listen to ""Fix You"" three or four times before you pass judgment on this album. Listening to ""Fix You"" is a similar revelatory experience to listening to ""The Scientist"". It gets better with every listen. This is a great album by a great band. Just give it a chance."
pos,"First off, people should except the fact that bands (especially ones that have staying power) change their sound and evolve from album to album. If they didn't, well where would the creativity be? X&Y is a beautifully crafted album that blends perfectly. Changing producers is not an easy thing to do, espeically when the last album was such a smash. ""Fix You"" is a masterpiece and hopefully the second single to be released. While other tracks such as ""The Hardest Part"" and ""What If? trademark Coldplay's sound. Well done and looks like this album will silence some critics as to whether this Brits have what it takes to take on U2. "
pos,"I've never listened to Coldplay before, but this Album is the best I have listened to in a long time. Listen to it on headphones really loud and it gets a whole new sound! I cannot understand it gets bad reviews. This is simply great music. Isn't it all a totally subjective question of taste and mood, anyway, How can anyone be in a position to trash it officially?"
pos,"Fantastic. The only things that bring it down are the sad facts it doesn't quite compete with parachues and a rush of blood to the head. Otherwise brilliant, a masterpice in song writing. the X part of the ablbum is near perfection! but sadly the Y part of X&Y lets the album down a bit, with the exeption of speed of sound(which i loved at first but has died on me) and swallowed in the sea. Definatly worth getting. Fixyou is such a beautiful song, possibly he most under-rated song ever? Alongside Shiver in parachutes! Other good songs are square one, a message and low. Other geat songs are What if Talk X&Y white shadows."
pos,"To start, I was never a huge Coldplay fan, they simply weren't the type of music I listened to, but I am listening now. And the more I listen to this cd, the more I love every minute of it. And to everyone who says that the lyrics are unoriginal, show me the songs that they ripped off. And if it is so unoriginal, let me take a look at some of your material, because I doubt any of you could write anything nearly as poetic as this. U2 can definitely rest assured that their torch will be passed on to capable hands! This is one of the best albums of the year so far!! Musically, this album puts you in almost a dream state, and the lyrics are easily relateable, yet moving all the same. Just give a listen to Fix You, a song I was told was writen about Gwyneth's late father, if you are not moved to tears, then you are emotionally inept. If you are a fan of music that is good on all levels, pick up this cd, it will NOT disappoint. "

pos,"i think this album could be a masterpiece of a lifetime but it seems like big names like rolling stone magazine and spin contradict themselves by calling the last 2 albums quote the work of a small band trying to act like a big band when at the time this two previous critics called both of the albums and the band itself like (gods)
"
pos,"Wow... all i can say is that this album is amazing. Yes, Martin's voice alone is nothing amazing. The lyrics easily forgetable. And the riffs easily lost. However, when all three are combined it leaves an album that is simply amazing. Very soothing, introspective, out of this world type experience. Highlights on the album include square one, fix you, my personal favorite talk, and swallowed in the sea. Most intresting on the album is the not-so-hidden track til' kingdom come, having a country feel to it (makes sense considering it was originally written for the late Johnny Cash). Definetely a must if you have enjoyed other Coldplay efforts"
pos,I really like the songs on this CD. They're the best.
pos,"Coldplay have moved on from Rush Of Blood and are making their way towards greatness... this isn't their peak, this is just a teaser for the albums they're going to make. It's a damn fine record, and ""Fix You"" in particular makes me break out into a broad smile. I can't help but feel that everything is going to be okay when I hear it. Thanks, boys."
pos,"solid rock album, many hooks, some minor Martin whining. A feminine U2 album"
neg,"How can anyone tolerate, let alone like, this ear piercing garbage. Go away Fred, you have enough money by now, please leave us all alone."
neg,"Fred Durst is a whiney, no talent hack....if you want something loud that is actually artistic go pick up the mars volta or some sex pistols. don't waste your time on this garbage."
neg,"God how I wish I wasn't forced to listen to this album. But I was, and the story isn't worth telling, and I'll have to leave it in the past. Oh, and if you like this music there may be something very wrong with you. It's beyond a matter of taste. You just may not be human, that's all."
neg,"I dont know about this album, i hate limp bizkit, its just another baby-metal band for kids. Up and down, up and down. I always agree with critics, they judge it with some criteria that are important for a good music."
neg,"This album is mediocre is only crap. 1.- The music is crap, only metal guitar whitout emoution or line whit the song, bateri and bass are mediocre, no innovate and is the same like other mediocre neo-punk band like God Charlote or neo metal like Linkin Park (Linkin Park Ultimete album is more best than this crap). Well the music no have style and nothin to say... checkout the music of The Smith... the instrument are alive. 2-. The Lyric and the concep of the album is junt crap the lyric of sad song are like ""Fuck you Fuck you i'm so sad Madafuker in the dark"" is all SHIT... Look the lyrics of Morrissey or The Stroke or AFI or or the crap of Evanencence the early albums of metalica. The albums of Nsync or Britney are best than this crap they are better pop than Limp Bizkit are. Limp Bizquit= Bad Pop whit Mediocre Rock Pretending darknes. Somebody tell Fred ""PLEASE SHUT YOUR HEAD AND NEVER DO A ALBUM AGAIN"" THE PEOPLE WHO LISEN LIMP BISKIT ARE IDIOT SKATE WANNABE WHO PRETENDING LISEN MUSIC AND NITHER KNOW HOW ARE VELVET UNDERGROUND. YEA RIGH THE ""ANTI-POP"" WHEN THEY ARE POP... BUT CRAP BOB... MORE CRAP THAN BSB"
neg,"ok, what can i say that hasn't already been said about limp bizkits album. nothing really all critics think it crap and so do i. fred for the love of god give it up, its over the whole rap-rock thing is on the way out, and when fred does try and make just metal his lyrics are what hold it down. fred if you really want to be famous that bad learn to play guitar, leave this band and never write lyrics again."
neg,"Durst is an ass pirate! Borland, I know you left, but you still munch the curtains! Total waste of good polycarbonate. Rape rock is sooooooo 1999!"
pos,"i think this album is great, and that everyone wants coldplay to do a ok computer, but i like x and y very much , especially fix you, swallowed in the sea and twisted logic"
pos,"martin says the band gave it thier best; i think they are experimenting with something new. after rush of blood, i guess i was hoping for an extension of that album. Put aside your preconceptions and listen, there are some real jewels on this album."
pos,"Just like their first 2 albums, this one'll grow on you. I don't know exactly why this is, but oh well. Musically, the album is great, with a few songs being extremely catchy, and progression in their sound is noticable. The areas where ""X&Y"" gets its demerits are lyrics and number of tracks on the album. Lyrically, the album is not so great. Martin covered a more diverse array of topics on ""A Rush of Blood to the Head."" All he writes about here is love, romance, and his feelings. I would have liked to see more lyrical diversity. As for number of songs, ""Twisted Logic"" and ""Low"" shouldn't have made the cut. The album should have been 11 songs long. Also, it just doesn't sound as fresh or as simplistically beautiful as ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" did when it first came out. However, ""X&Y"" still delivers the goods. It's very solid and very consistent. And hey, it's still great, just not exceptional like ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" was. "
pos,"The best new release so far this year! Coldplay has an album that will stand up for a long time.
"
pos,"well I read most of the comments that were posted here and I also took a chance and bought the CD for myself since I am a major Coldplay fan. I listened to it and in my opinion it was great. whoever said that the more you listen the more you like it was right but I think that all their CDs have done that to me. Though it does have many cliches and isn't as great as Rush of blood is..im no music critic but I do know what I like and I like this CD and for those who trash it, you are entitled to your opinion but do remember that everyone is different and everyone is not going to like the same things. there would be no fun in it and the world would be boring, not to mention a very 'outter limits'/ 'twilight zone' kind of place "
neg,"Their first three albums were garbage, and the fourth continues the tradition. You can tell that they've tried to get a little less cheesey and go back to more of a metal feel, but it doesn't help the fact that Fred Durst is possibly the worst vocalist/lyricist in the history of rock music. This is a must-have for 12-year old girls and high school football players, but anyone with any sense of style or intelligence will probably want to pass. "
neg,"Limp Bizkit rock? a 30+ yrs old man who can't play instrument, acts like he just got into puberty. and screams ""fuck"" so many times I wonder if Fred recorded this in prison washroom. man if you think that rock, get this album"
neg,"Sad, formulaic tripe which does more to epitomize how lazy and brainless my generation is than any other album this year."
neg,"Satan gave us da bizkit. It marks our decline back to monkeyhood brain damage. Who listens to bizkit, deserves no better."
neg,"Wow....I never thought music could be soooo bad. This is almost as bad as Celine Dion or Michael Bolton, who at least have one excuse to still exist...they can actually sing (though, if anyone with any brain cells at all will probably testify, it's still like sitting through Hell.)"
neg,"What the hell were they thinking, fred durst is a tosser. Behind Blue Eyes sucks pure donkey dick!"
neg,this is wank... just shows that wes had all the creative talent
neg,"How about a -45,000,000,000 for the score. This album's booklet is toilet paper if I ever saw some. The disc itself doesn't even make a good coaster or even a frisbee. The lyrics are embarassingly horrid, the music is bland and lifeless. Durst's supposed rage is whiny and cringe-worthy, and never comunicates anything but feces. I wonder if anyone heard this before it was released. If they had they probably would have tossed the originals out the window of a seventeen story building. Limp Bizkit live up to their name. "
neg,"Limp Bizkit were barely tolerable when they were new. Fred Durst is a brainless hack who lucked into a musical career. Hopefully this is the death knell for Angry White Boy rock, nu metal, rap rock, or however you want to describe it. This is the epitomy of soulless, whining narcissicm. Good job Fred, now go get in line to participate in Surreal Life."
neg,the cover of ''behing blue eyes'' is insulting to music. this whole album is insulting to mankind
neg,"I pretty much love ""Ben S"" and I couldn't agree with him more. BUT WAIT, something catchy? Ah, wait. Just kidding. Kudos for miraculously catching the public's attention though."
pos,Amazing! So many rock and pop bands put out so much thoughtless crap. This is a refreshing change
pos,"This is a very good album, not a complete departure, but an evolution. While it will be compared to U2 and others, I see a possible lineage, perhaps unintended, to John Lennon. The melodies, harmonies, suggest an affinity."
pos,"This is an excellent cd! It is near flawless and very good quality music, possibly my favorite album of all time. Speed of Sound, Fix You, Square One and White Shadows are some of the highlights. Coldplay is now officially my favorite band."
pos,"Square One, Speed of Sound and Talk are great songs, but too many of the rest are mediocre, run-of-the-mill. A decent album, but nowhere near as good as Rush of Blood"
pos,"I really like this CD. It did take a few times to get use to it (being a veteran Coldplay fan). They do tend to fall the last few songs (kind of sappy Gwenyth songs). I do believe alot of the critics are trying to compare this to Parachutes and A Rush... but, you cannot. Just like you could not compare A Rush.. to Parachutes. They all have there place. I do however think that 'Fix you' should have been put on the CD last. It would've followed the pattern they had created with the last songs on there prior CD's. This is definatley worth picking up . The first 9 songs on the album are worth it! "
pos,"This is one of those albums you come to appreciate over time. It isn't as easy to take hold of as ""A rush of blood to the head"" or as mellow has ""Parachutes"" it takes a second listen and becomes better and better. Often the falsetto's Martin gives birth to are criticised for being sung before. Although that is the his sound, and he puts his own twist to it, especially on this album. Songs like Square One are new and innovative without losing that authentic Coldplay sound. I think that most of us don't really care for it to be innovative, we just want more coldplay."
neg,"I don't know what happened, they never been the best but not that bad"
neg,"Yeah, Limp Bizkit can shove it. A selection of lyrics from Results May Vary: ""No doubt that I'd love to sniff on them panties now"" Wow, I'm in AWE of Fred's talent as a songwriter. Seriously though, anyone who can belt out crpa like that and not feel like a douche shouldn't be anywhere in music, plain and simple, and anyone who can tolerate listeing to this crap does not deserve the ability to have an opinion. Go listen to some Danzig, Black Sabbath, Tool, The Misfits, or hell, I'd say it'd be better to listen to Cannibal Corpse than this crap."
neg,this album is one more garbage album of the contemporanie era. Please tell to Fred taht he want suecide do.
neg,"lets give this album some careful, consideration, listen, relisten and till, oh whats the point, FOR CHRISSAKES FRED NOONE CARES YOU FAT OLD FRATBOY, ahh"
neg,"Alrite. So there I was, in the movie theater finishing Gothica. Then as the credits start to roll, I hear ""Behind Blue Eyes"". I notice right away that its not The Who, yet I still think it is decent. After finding out it was Limp Bizkit, I purchased the cd. I turned on the cover of ""Behind Blue Eyes"" right away and actually started getting into it. And then, when the amazing interlude from the original I am shocked to hear it coming late. And then not at all. And then some Simon Says like voice coming on saying discover. I mean seriously. What the hell? I think that alone should earn this cd at least a 3...Now, the rest of the cd, that is what drops it down to a zero. This cd is so horrible that I actually recomend that you go to your local music store, buy it, take it home, and frame it along with a Hillary Duff cd and you'll have your very own wall of shame. Someone shoot Fred Durst"
neg,2003'S WORST. Simply put it this way : it's baaaaad.
neg,You can't buy this and say you have good taste in music. It's that simple.
neg,"So many things went wrong with this album. First and foremost: Fred Durst still can't write lyrics to save his life. He's 30-something years old and still writes with the mindset of a drunken frat boy. Secondly: The band's best musician, guitarist Wes Borland, is MIA on RESULTS MAY VARY. Mike Smith does an okay job replacing Borland, but it simply isn't the same. Third, like ""Chocolate Starfish"" before it, the album runs on too long (although not as long as ""Chocolate Starfish,"" where seven tracks out of the eight in the album's second half exceeded five minutes in length). Third: The cover of ""Behind Blue Eyes"" is the best song on the album. This is a problem for two reasons: a) The instrumental from the original has been replaced by a dull, monotonous voice repeating ""L-I-M-P...discover"" over and over; and b) If a subpar cover of someone else's song is the best song on your band's album, then you're probably in big trouble because none of your own songs are standing out as much. The only thing that could have made this album any worse is if they stuck with their original idea for the album title and called this record -- I kid you not -- PANTY SNIFFER"
neg,one of the two WORST albums ever (along with Lostprophets - Start Something)
neg,This album has some okay songs but overall this is a truly dreadful album. There is a reason whilst many people don't like Limp Bizkit and this is exactly why a mess of an album.
neg,"I would honestly listen to a cat getting its tail chopped off than this. Chocolate Starfish & The Hot Dog Flavored Water was bad, but not terrible. This, however, is a travesty. Not one single song is worth listening to, and what's even worse is that they made a cover of the beautiful The Who song ""Behind Blue Eyes"". All the people who gave this 10s just wrote ""Hey, this CD rocks! Go Limp Bizkit!"" ""Another masterpiece by the great Limp Bizkit!"" No. Just NO. Those are not valid arguments. After listening through the whole album I just wish I could take it all back. I will admit it, though, it's not the worst album I have ever heard; Kevin Federline beat them to it three years later."
neg,"If you are regarded by Limp Bizkit fans (some of the dumbest fans of all time) as a big mistake, I think it's time to reconsider your career."
neg,"Anybody who first tuned into Liz Phair during her indie period 10 years ago, when she was signed to Matador and recorded the much-admired Exile in Guyville, will listen to this new major-label offering and assume that Phair must have fallen under the influence of an evil svengali armed with personality-warping drugs. Where she used to be smart and provocative, Phair has become crass and bloated, her lyrics crude and her image apparently a grotesque exercise in self-parody.
Once renowned for barbed commentaries on the ""women in rock"" theme, her new songs are more like audio pornography, splattered messily with her thoughts on shagging, lust and underwear. In case you hadn't noticed the terrifying decline in her songwriting, the sleeve depicts Phair semi-naked with a guitar between her legs, and in the booklet she pouts and poses like a superannuated Lolita. Not a pretty sight. Or sound."
neg,"The notion of Branch and Avril Lavigne as the anti-Britneys has been so overplayed that you'd think they were Joni Mitchell and Patti Smith. That's not fair -- they point in more substantial directions than Spears et al, but their debut albums were, in truth, just different shades of professionally polished, fashion-conscious teen-pop.
It also would be unfair to expect a breakthrough simply because Branch is heading out of teenhood. Still, it would have been nice if she'd, uh, branched out more on this second album. ""Hotel Paper"" is state-of-the-art pop, written by Branch (with producer John Shanks co-writing four songs). There's just no sense of an emerging artist at work, of anything that's specifically Branch's vision in play.
The most distinctive moments seem borrowed, such as ""Love Me Like That"" -- a duet with Sheryl Crow that could be a Stevie Nicks song, right down to the Lindsey Buckingham-like guitar figure and gypsy reference.
The only thing Branch sings about is dating problems, and she does so in generic terms. Even in ""Tuesday Morning,"" when she muses ""we were finding out who we are,"" it's not an existential issue but a relationship one.
Branch has experienced a big, wide world out there in the last couple of years. Too bad it's not reflected in her songs."
neg,"it could be said that Liz Phair's greatest asset has always been her inability to write a perfect pop song. On her 1993 debut, Exile in Guyville, Phair's gruff voice wrapped awkward non-hooks around flimsy, transparent chord progressions, resulting in (to everyone's surprise) a certifiable indie roadtrip classic. It still stands as a powerfully confrontational album, skirting convention yet marked by Phair's striking awareness of her own limitations.
Unfortunately, it seems that Phair has spent the better part of her post-Exile career trying to gloss over the very limitations that made her original statement so profound. Though her second album, Whip-Smart, had a few choice moments which recalled the insight and complexity of Exile, it ultimately seemed like a much more calculated affair. Things didn't start to go horribly awry, of course, until Phair's next album, Whitechocolatespaceegg. That record's attempts to radio-ize her sound only dismantled the depth of her music-- if not the awkwardness-- resulting in an odd batch of songs that perhaps encapsulated Phair's faulty view of what constitutes a radio-friendly album.
Ten years on from Exile, Liz has finally managed to achieve what seems to have been her goal ever since the possibility of commercial success first presented itself to her: to release an album that could have just as easily been made by anybody else. Even the songs on Liz Phair that could be considered ""shocking"" or ""profound"" are gratuitous and overdetermined, eschewing the stark and accusatory insights of Exile in favor of pointless f-bombs, manipulative ballads, and foul-mouthed shmeminism.
Liz Phair has always been known for her vulgarity, but on Exile and parts of Whip-Smart, she put that trait to good use. On ""Fuck and Run"", a standout from Exile, Phair used the word's negative connotations as a means of pointed self-deprecation and lamented, ""Whatever happened to a boyfriend/ The kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it/ I want a boyfriend/ I want all that stupid old shit/ Letters and sodas."" ""Flower"", Phair's most notorious track to date, reads like a laundry list of graphic sexual desires, but rather than paint a uniformly flattering portrait of her love interest, he's immature, he's obnoxious, and despite it all, she still wants to fuck his brains out-- a simple, necessarily crude semi-contradiction that speaks volumes.
""Flower"" would seem to have a descendent in ""H.W.C."" (""Hot White Cum""), in which Phair extols the virtue of semen as a beauty aid (""...Dear Cosmo: Splooge, The New Rouge!""). But, unlike the complex, alternatingly cocky and self-effacing sexuality of ""Flower,"" ""H.W.C.""'s unqualified sperm-praise is entirely vain and degrading. Even more degrading is the constipated donkeyfuck harmonica solo towards the track's end, a hilarious sideshow that only magnifies the triteness of the song's glycerin-slick production.
Though ""H.W.C."" is without question the best water-cooler conversation piece on Liz Phair, ""Rock Me"" makes for a close second. Here, Phair sings exuberantly about the benefits of an affair with a younger guy including-- I shit you not-- ""[playing] Xbox on [his] floor."" In between choruses of, ""Baby baby baby if it's alright/ Want you to rock me all night,"" Phair declares, ""I'm starting to think that young guys rule!"" without a trace of self-doubt or reflection. It's hard to imagine that the Liz Phair of ten years ago wouldn't have had something profound and devastating to say about older women who shack up with clueless college kids, but on ""Rock Me""-- as on the rest of Liz Phair-- vapid, clich‚-filled rhyme couplets dominate.
Take, for example, the album's first single, ""Why Can't I"", ""co""-written by Avril Lavigne songwriting team The Matrix. With a chorus of, ""Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?"" and a cookie-cutter rock/pop background, the song could easily pass for Michelle Branch. The lyric, ""We haven't fucked yet/ But my head's still spinning,"" seemingly seeks to set Phair apart from the teen-pop crowd, but the use of the word is completely gratuitous-- change it to ""kissed"" and stick a 16-year-old girl in front of the mic and no one could tell the difference.
Only on ""Little Digger"" does Phair attempt to tackle subject matter unique to the circumstances of her own life as a 36-year-old single mother. The song has received positive press for addressing a difficult issue, as Phair sings to her son about his absent father and the new men she's dating. But the fact that anything positive could be said about this track speaks only to the overwhelming lack of substance on this record. From its cloying synthstring arrangements to its ballad-in-a-box drumbeat to its infuriatingly manipulative chorus of, ""My mother is mine,"" ""Little Digger"" offers up all the insight and emotion of a UPN sitcom.
In recent interviews, Phair has been upfront about her hopes of mainstream success, and claims full awareness that Liz Phair is likely to alienate many of her original fans. What she doesn't seem to realize is that a collection of utterly generic rocked-out pop songs isn't likely to win her many new ones. It's sad that an artist as groundbreaking as Phair would be reduced to cheap publicity stunts and hyper-commercialized teen-pop. But then, this is ""the album she has always wanted to make""-- one in which all of her quirks and limitations are absorbed into well-tested clich‚s, and ultimately, one that may as well not even exist."
neg,"In the end, this can't even make you feel angry; just desperately sad."
neg,"Honestly Loud doesn't compare to GGGB or Rated R, total letdown. I don't understand the appeal of this album at all. I like Rihanna but these songs ain't cutting it."
neg,"Wow, Im shocked at these reviews, Not too shocked because Critics Overrate & Underrate thing all the time. Poor Rihanna"
neg,"Loud"" was a mistake in comparison with Good Girl Gone Bad and Rated R. The only track who was good was Love The Way You Lie (Pt. II). And when Rihanna said: ""I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do..."" that shows that she thinks she's better that the three artists. And that egomania it showed in Only Girl (In the World). There are not Rihanna songs, they will be if she wrote or co-wrote it. Forgettable "
neg,"Didn't Rihanna say she didn't want to make ""generic pop records""? Well, she failed terribly. Such a boring, unoriginal album. Nothing special, really. There are some tracks that are decent but, well, they're forgettable. I've already forgotten what they're called and how they go. ""Only Girl"" has nice music, but Rihanna kills it by completely screaming the chorus, which is uncomfortable to hear. Also, she needs to stop singing songs about how she likes rough men and getting hurt. First there was Russian Roulette, Rude Boy and Love the Way You Lie, and now there's songs like S&M, which I hear will be a single. My God, she really seems to like it rough, doesn't she?"
neg,"There are only 3 good songs on this album and the rest is filler. The good songs are S&M, What's My Name, and Only Girl (In the World). None of these songs are unforgettable, even though Only Girl the most solid song among the three worth listening to."
neg,Rihanna is a very very overrated and untalented singer. This album is full of generic and repetitive songs. Very few songs are worth it. Avery forggetable album.
pos,"It soars, it drops, it leaves you wanting more, it leaves you wishing that Johnny Cash sang ""Til Kingdom Come""...most of all it leaves you with that warm feeling that all good albums do. Has great lines ""my song is love, love unkown and I've got to get that message home"", songs about angst, songs about love, songs about loss, songs about today...it just fits and you will love listening to it front to back, which is the true test of a good album."
pos,"Dear Coldplay: Ok Boys, a good effort although it's still 2 songs too long: you should have ditched A Message. Sorry, Chris I know you really like it. It's just too... YOU. Save it for a better moment. And Swallowed In the Sea is too easy-fake-genre music. why is it even in there? You're trying too hard for what... a campfire classic. Please! The rest of it: Sonically, it's a bit overcooked, right? time to strip down. you guys are good enough and big enough that next time you have to let it loosen up a bit on some songs. But again, thanks for having the cojones to do such huge and gracious tunes, no one is this good at it. Lyrically, this is your get-out-of-jail-free card. Are you listening to us, Chris? take note! It is the very last time you should ever shoot for so low a common denominator. I mean come on, man. The world is already listening, take us somewhere fascinating and new next time. We like you and we want to hear it."
pos,"Colplay really grew up on this album, and we get the benefits."
pos,"I've been a Coldplay fan since before Parachutes was even released in the US. I really liked Parachutes, I loved Rush of Blood. I must admit that it took several listens for this album to really grow on me... But, like any great album, it has only gotten better with each listen. While this album has gotten rave reviews by some, I am shocked by the number of negative reviews. You feel like each song on X&Y was crafted extremely carefully and molded to perfection. This is a classic third album... different enough from the previous two to be unique, but not too different to alienate fans of the Coldplay sound. They are moving in the right direction... I already can't wait for what they come up with next. I would list some favorite tracks, but then I'd have to list every song on the album! X&Y was worth the wait for me!"
pos,"Quite beautiful album. All songs really stick in your head. If you give it 4-5 spins you will think that this is Coldplay's greatest. I was with them from the start. ""Parachutes"" was good, but ""A Rush Of Blood..."" was even better, and the change that Coldplay has made with this new album is quite astonishing. I can't understand why so many of the old Coldplay fans, think that ""X&Y"" is a dissapointment. I think that this is Coldplay at there very best, like Zep on ""Physical Graffiti""."
pos,"The only people who would give this album a 7 or less are those on the anti-Coldplay bandwagon that is rolling around right now. X&Y sees Coldplay evolve once again, and after about 15 listens every track has something to make it special. This is a work of art that has to be heard to be believed."
pos,"While songs like Square One and Low are terrific, there are some pondering fillers towards the end that are frankly quite dull. And ""Fix You"" is nowhere near as good as everyone is pretending it is. This is a good album, but not the masterpiece that is being sychophantically claimed."
pos,"Many reviews have looked past the obvious. Chris and the band have elgantly placed a full description of their album in the title, X&Y. This album is full; full of landscapes that vary and contrast from one to the next just like the emotional variances of our own lives. Its full of sounds, complexities that demand an attentive listener. Its big and bold, similar enough to be welcomed as comforting, but driven and chaotic enough to challenge and tweek our perception. An album that embraces the past and propells us and Coldplay forward. "
pos,"Simply fantasic, works incredibly as an album, im glad im not the one who has to pick singles out."
pos,it is really astonishing as to why critics are accusing the band of not being revolutionary and bold enough.
pos,"I've been a fan since 'clocks' was released from a rush of blood. Some may say its the same old coldplay formula, but whats wrong with that? If the musics great, why change for change sake? Excellent thought provoking songs; square one, what if, talk (my fave!) fix you, speed of sound and swallowed in the sea are my highlights.."
pos,"After listening all the way through 4 times this album has grown on me (worked it's way from a 6 to an 8). It is defintely not an album that is immediately listenable like their previous efforts. 'Square One' is IMHO the best opening to any Coldplay album to date and 'White Shadows' has a great chorus and rhythm to it. 'Kingdom Come' is by far my biggest surprise on this album though. I didn't think that Coldplay had the ability or desire to play some thing with such bluegrass/country roots. Should have been a main track and not hidden. XY isn't any better/worse than Rush of Blood. The different approach taken on most songs works for me and serves as a nice change of pace from Rush of Blood. I do understand some negative reviews based on lyrical content (Martin isn't exactly a lyrical whiz-kid) but lyrics are typically so personal that there are bound to be people for whom some lyrics just dont work. Nice to see that Coldplay made a stronger attempt to get away from the standard verse, chorus, verse format of most songs for this album. Look forward to hearing the songs performed live to see if there is a different sound to be gained from some of the songs i didn't like as much e.g. Twisted Logic and A Message."
pos,"This album really grows on you. Don't judge it on the first listen. Let it sit in the player for a while. Do some cleaning while you're listening to it. Do some homework. Write earnest love letters that you'll never send. Let it sink into you. Eventually, like any great album, it becomes the ONLY thing you want to hear. It becomes part of who you are."
pos,This album is simply BRILLIANT. It takes a few listens but it keeps growing on you. It's my favorite cd by far.
pos,"Ok, unfortunatly this album is NOT a masterpiece... and because there was so much anticipation about it, many fans are a bit dissapointed... but it would nevertheless be a lie to say this is a bad work! Some songs are a bitirritating (X & Y, twisted logic) but Speed of sound and White Shadows totally rock and there are many goregous ballades, my two favourite being the catchy Swallowed in the Sea and the AMAZING Til kingdom comes."
pos,"the songs themselves are much better than previous efforts, but i still ended up being disappointed after listening to all of it several times. mainly because it not only loses the intimacy of parachutes but also the catchiness of a rush of blood, without significantly progressing musically. not too impressed."
pos,"One of my top 5 favorite albums of all time.I didn't even like AROBTTH all that much(had its fair share of great songs,though),but this album is just amazing.It has more personality,flavor,anything you want to call it.It's not quite perfect,but it's very close."
pos,This is one of the best albums brought up by coldplay. A true classic with its adventurous songs.
pos,"I love Coldplay and am enjoying their new CD very much. Do I love every single song on X&Y? No, but I never love every song on any CD I purchase, and I certainly don't hate any song on this album. Coldplay hits the mark so much more often than they miss. X&Y is a hit with me, and I am thrilled to have another Coldplay CD to add to my collection. And I will be seeing them on their concert tour this summer, and there aren't too many bands I feel are worth the effort!"
neg,"A good album with tons of hits. What's my name is my favorite, followed by Love the Way You Lie. Some of the songs are filler though like Complicated and Fading."
neg,"I do not see how anyone with respect for music, or anyone with respect for themselves for that matter, can like such an awful monstrosity such as Nicki Minaj. Literally all she raps/sings/whatever the vocals are called..well, lets just call it ""rapping"", but the only thing she ""raps"" about is sex and drugs. ""Anaconda"" is the worst song on the album (although it has become the creator of a few jokes that are quite funny)."
neg,"This album isn't rap, it's pop-rap/trap. I still can't understand the Minaj's fanbase, this album it's horrible, please, stop saying that she do good music, she's just like fetty wap, a trash idol. This album is full of bad songs, the ""pop side"" of the album have ""Pills N Potions"", a boring horrible song, ""Bed of Lies"", an other electropop song without a original style, ""Grand Piano"", the best song of the album, a medium pop song where the Minaj have a good voice, but the song it's pretty boring, ""Feeling Myself"", a pop-rap song with maybe the worst flow of the history (comparable with Souja boy's songs) and ""The Night Is Still Young"", the worst songs in the album, simply horrible, the ""trap side"" of the album have ""Anaconda"", a pure trash song, ""Only"" maybe one of the best songs of the album, but it's still a horrible song, will be better without Drake and Lil Wayne, and ""Truffle Butter"", the same horrible sh*t. I hope that one day Nicki Minaj will stop to do this annoying noises."
neg,"what has happened to radiohead? This album is dull and lifeless. Its the most boring recording they have ever made. I guess we have just seen them jump the shark. Cannot believe the good reviews this is getting. King of Limbs was head and shoulders above this. I will be generous and give it a 1 because burn the witch is ok, it raised my hopes, but I have been listening to this since it came out thinking it will start to sound better but no, its just a terrible and boring album."
neg,"Burn the Witch sits at the front of this album like a siren luring you into another 50ish minutes of complete and utter boredom. I cannot believe the rave reviews this is getting from fans. Strong, energetic tracks that were abundant as recently as In Rainbows are nowhere to be found. This is not a rock album - the only exception being the opening track. Apart from a few moments, this album drifts by in a manner that offers nothing to keep your attention, eventually coming to an abrupt end with yet another song that was not even written in the past few years, only to leave you shrugging your shoulders. Massively disappointed to find out that the band didn't seem to come to terms with the issues that made The King of Limbs such a let down. "
neg,"Those waiting since In Rainbows for another good Radiohead/Thom Yorke record will have to keep waiting. 

Or if you want it bad enough you can say this is as good as Kid A. Wait a year to see if you still think that or are brave enough to say so in public. 

When the first single dropped I thought ?yes they?re back.? I had that song on repeat for hours on end. 

Then when the ?Daydreaming? vid was released I was worried. Not only is the video some of PTA?s lamest work, it featured an especially greasy Yorke wandered though a multitude of doors without finding whatever it is that he has long lost. 

Do a search for A Moon Shaped Pool and the adjective ?lush? and your browser might crash. Apparently you must listen to this record with headphones to appreciate the ?lush? production. 

Ultimately the best production techniques cannot deliver the best tunes. And this record is a collection of formally rejected songs given the full film score treatment. A one-note, often out of tune Yorke doesn?t help. Nor do his nauseatingly bad 60?s protest song lyrics: We are of the Earth / To her we do return / The future is inside us. 

And what about the choirs on the record - was Guy Garvey credited for those? 

Then there?s the closer in ?True Love Waits?. We are supposed to feel the poignancy of Yorke?s divorce. I think the greater tragedy is that the truer version of this track is found where it belongs, when Radiohead were at their peak, "
neg,This is a band on auto pilot. It's a mess of boring noise with nothing to offer unless your looking looking to impress other Radiohead fans with how much you can put up with this lack luster lump of junk. I've been with them from the start but after this and king of limbs I'm out!
neg,"I love Radiohead, but I'm not going to blindly fall in line like so many others for an album that is underwhelming, at best. They completely botched what was a great song in True Love Waits, and the rest of the record makes it clear that the majority of these tracks were just previously demoed songs that they decided to throw together into an album. If you actually think there is any kind of concept behind this record, you're fooling yourself. But regardless of that, I'm strictly looking at this record from a melodic perspective -- and the bottom line is it's lacking. It doesn't grip you like (some) of the tracks on King of Limbs, and is nowhere close to reaching masterpiece status like In Rainbows ultimately achieved. I would have rather waited another 5 years than be given this half effort record full of b-sides. And in regards to the reviews, Radiohead could have put out a record of 10 white noise tracks, and Radiohead fans would be calling it a revolutionary record. So take them with a strong grain of salt. "
neg,"Oh my god what a fantastically boring album. Every song sounds the same. Alright, so I'm no Radiohead fan per se, but just thought I'd give it a go. Doubt I will ever listen to another one of these songs ever again. I probably don't get it or something, but hey. Reviews are subjective, yeah?"
pos,"easily on my top 5 ever! unsurprisingly, pop snobs will dismiss them as a stadium band... but who cares when coldplay can release records so well crafted like this one? HUGE."
pos,"This cd grows on you, just like their previous. When ""Rush of Blood"" came out, I intially didn't think it as good a ""Parachutes"". When I first heard X&Y I didn't think it matched up to ""Rush"". But the more I listen to it, the more I love it. Only two week tracks in my opinion, the rest are pretty great. For those that complain this band isn't eeperimental enough, your missing the point. If every band were like Radiohead or Mars Volta (both of whom I love) it would be pretty boring. They do their things. Coldplay does theirs -- and very, very well. "
pos,"I had always enjoyed Coldplay's singles, but never really connected with an entire CD they produced. X&Y, though, is easily one of the best purchases I have ever made and a solid piece of work the entire way through. I'd say this is easily their best music yet, and hopefully is just a teaser for even better things to come."
pos,"An album that is the definition of a grower - those who can't see its beauty simply aren't listening. Every single song a craker (especially live), but track 4 - fix you - a fantastic 'shivers down your spine' song when it kicks in."
pos,this is the best cd ever and all the songs rock.
pos,The best record since Ok Computer!
pos,"This may be their best effort yet. While I can't hear any stadium-sized rockers on this album, there's real beauty in some of the songs. The album reaches a real peak in the middle with the songs Fix You, Talk, X&Y, and Speed of Sound. What really differentiates this album from their previous efforts is their willingness to put the guitar front-and-center with this album as opposed to the piano. It's just enough to keep Coldplay from sounding derivative of themselves."
pos,"On my first few listens I was a little dissapointed in the CD. I really appreciated their first two albums and this seemed like a let down. However the CD began to grow on me and I really started to hear the music not listen too it and my view changed. The melodies and rythymns are strong and it may sound similiar to earlier works but they have differnt twists to make each song it's own. It is relaxing thought provacative music. I understand it is not for everyone, but it is for me. "
pos,"Why don't these critics get it? ""X&Y"" is just full of melody, flow, and rythym. And these people call themselves ""music critics"". This album..when all is said and done will be a classic..kind of like U2's Joshua Tree. I, like most Coldplay fans cannot comprehend as to why bad reviews are written about this album..it is simply great music..just shut up and listen. Oh by the way...Chris Martin is a very underrated singer, that boy can sing oh can he sing."

neg,The album is a masterpiece but musically incorrect. It takes you to a different world that is peaceful. But the meaningless notes disturb the whole atmosphere of relaxation. I don't understand why artists go against the rules of music and do such weired things which have no meaning. I cannot accept incorrect music from a music album.
neg,"It seems there's a time in every white, male, middle class, suburban millennial's life where we, usually around the age of 13, fall in love with Radiohead. It's a perfectly natural reaction. Their melodramatic, angst-ridden screeds against vague ideas of corporate evil and heads of state fit perfectly into our newly minted interests in things we can hardly begin to understand. But you don't need to understand much to fully appreciate being holed up in your bedroom listening to Let Down on blast on our iPod alarm clock radio while thinking about your crush in Algebra who looked at you for a full 2 seconds that day. For their part, Radiohead has done well in transitioning these 13 y/os with burgeoning interests in music to transition to less juvenile acts. They've aped Talking Heads, Sonic Youth, Can, etc and thusly led their teenage fans down that road. Fast forward to their latest, 'A Moon Shaped Pool'. Radiohead seem to have given up on appropriating genuinely interesting music in favor of rehashing what sounds like a mishmash of Coldplay's greatest hits. For any well-learned, well-listened educated person the fact that the album is bad is not surprising. Radiohead have never produced a genuinely good album in their careers. But, still, they served a valuable purpose in the lives of music fans by leading them to greener pastures. With their ninth record instead they give them the finger and point to A.M.-radio-Superbowl-halftime-life-insurance-commercial """"rock"""" music. Rock in scare quotes because as much as they still retain their love for guitars and drums and bass this is the most flaccid sound ever produced from an ostensibly uproarious art form. I mean, Steely Dan managed to make tepid rock music sound nice by combining it with white-people-jazz and a supreme ear for melody but I can't say anything as redeeming for this heap Radiohead has put out. It's mid-tempo background music for 50 minutes. I almost don't want to call this music. 'Music' has the import of art. This sounds like computer-generated sound for playing in department stores meant to keep young shoplifters out of the store by boring them to tears."
neg,Does Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood even know what they're doing anymore? This Album is degrading towards its fans and to those who'll accidentally have it shuffled and disjointed way deep into the full discography of Radiohead. Zero stars. Zero points. Two thumbs down. Rotten score. Rotten album.
pos,"Some very harsh words have been said against what is arguably the best British band going at present. To say the lyrics are 'crappy' and the songs are a 'Radiohead spin-off' really shows some of you lot obviously don't use your ears to listen to music. Coldplay scrapped a staggering 60 songs to make the album as good as possible, and I would say they've succeeded. Yes, they have incorperated some electronic sounding into the album, but by no means does this make the songs sound exactly like Radiohead. Songs like 'Square One', 'Talk' and 'White Shadows' demonstrate some beautiful riffs, drum beats and inspirational music, whilst the album killers (Speed of Sound, Fix You being the main offerings) are truly excellent songs. Yes, the album is overatted by the media, and yes this isn't a Parachutes, but without a doubt this is a superb delicacy of passion which Chris and the lads should be proud of."
pos,"This is a very good album. There isnt really much to say about it, its almost perfection. Speed of sound, the most played track of the album on TV, is really a masterpiece people will look back in twenty years and say, atleast the 2000s has some good music"
pos,"People have slammed this because it's not as great as A Rush Of Blood To The Head...but nothing ever will be. This one takes lots of repeated play throughs before you understand and feel the album - something many critics will never do. It takes time, and if you push on with it, you'll finally get it and realise how great it is. It's let down by a few songs, namely A Message, but shines with Low, Twisted Logic, Talk and the title track, X&Y."
pos,"A certainly underrated album! I love every single song on it even though they needed some time to reveal their beauty. But aren't those the best ones? I love albums that have to grow, because they are the most lasting ... I could listen to it over and over again and it wouldn't get boring at all"
pos,"Coldplay is my all-time favorite band. Let's get that out of the way first. Thus, it irks me to give them this mediocre rating but X+Y surprisingly gets it wrong more than it gets it right. The production is either too sparse or too heavy-handed in a few places which annoys me for some inexplicable reason because I don't usually mind production--or lack thereof. All in all, X+Y is extremely top-heavy. The first five songs are all brilliant (for Coldplay's standards at least). Then you get the title track which is truly filler and then the boring, recycled Speed of Sound. The birds go flying at the speed of sound to show you where it all began.....what?! A Message is the last glimmer of hope for the rest of the record. After that none of the songs stick, regretfully. Chris tries to meander into Radiohead territory with Twisted Logic but fails. The impromptu 'Til Kingdom Come is ironically one of the best songs on the whole record even if it is a 'hidden track'. But alas Coldplay, I still forgive you and will be enjoying Talk for years to come. X+Y is a misstep but no one's careers have been totally illustrious."
pos,"This is first really alternative music coldplay's album , its an superb ambitious experiment ,first real contact of romantic lyricks and cold, calculated rock-electronic music which rings In Your ears for a long long time after You listen to this for the first time.Moving stuff!"
pos,"Give this album five listens. Learn ""Fix You,"" ""A Message"" and ""Til Kingdom Come."" Before very long you will want to grab a torch and sprint to the top of a giant hill, waving the torch like a madman, setting fire to the hillside and drooling all over your bare feet."
pos,"listening to Coldplay without prejudice is hard to do, now that it is common knowledge that it is one of the top bands today."
pos,"I think this album is better than the previous one. Critics are being too tough saying it's the exact same formula. It's not really. You can feel a change there and it's very welcome. Some songs are among their best. I'm thinking : Fix you, Talk, X&Y. A great coldplay CD, a good rock cd, a great pop cd."
pos,"This album, though not at all experimental or demanding of its listener, is nevertheless sublime, passionate and without doubt the best thing Coldplay have ever done. I find it incredible that there are so many negative reviews for this album. Just listen to it a few times rather than once or twice before reaching an opinion!!"
neg,It was the anger and angst of a jilted 20-year-old that gave the original songs their edge--something entirely absent from these blandly matured acoustic versions. 
neg,"While old Alan Morris might not be picking up proper awards any more, she could well be in for a chance of DiS? new ?most pointless release of the year? trophy. Yes, ?Jagged Little Pill Acoustic? is about as welcome as a bout of testicular cancer, and at least twice as ugly as that goblin-faced nurse you just _know is gonna be the one to shave your pre-op balls.
?But why the surprise?? I hear you cry. ?This was dogturd the first time round, wasn?t it?? Well, yes, I realise that people, but let?s give the poor woman half a bloody chance OK? Sweet jesus, you tarts.
One reason you might bother recording acoustic versions of your songs is to strip them back and reveal some form of deeply hidden beauty. But without any good songs all Morris can do is strip them back to reveal their not-so-deeply hidden utter shitness. Hits like ?All I Really Want? and ?Hand In My Pocket? may have sounded like they had a tune in all their Glen Ballard-produced rambunctiousness, but apparently it was all studio tricks and haberdashery. Ho hum.
Where there was once teen angst, there is nowt but middle-aged resignation. And no, the lyrics to ?Ironic? still aren?t bloody ironic."
neg,"Stripped of the rough guitars and eclectic production of the original, two things are exposed - those words and that voice. Neither fare well."
neg,The once fist-raising anthems for the Lilith generation have been replaced by the bland.
neg,"At risk of causing Britain's record company boardrooms to collapse in hysterical laughter, it is worth noting that some albums can be too successful. Just ask Alanis Morissette. In 1995, she hit barely believable paydirt with her third album, Jagged Little Pill, an odd curate's egg of a record. In the debit column, Jagged Little Pill was clearly a cynical and calculated move, an attempt to simultaneously jump aboard two passing alt-rock bandwagons (grunge's angst-ridden guitar overload and the confessional female singer-songwriter style of Tori Amos and Liz Phair) by a singer previously known for big-haired dance-pop, and a producer called Glenn Ballard, famed for working with bleeding-edge artists including Curtis Stigers and David Hasselhoff. In the credit column, the album's accusatory despair rang true. Prior to its making, Morissette's relationship with an older music industry figure had collapsed, leading her to write screeds of self-obsessed vitriol instead of lyrics.
Jagged Little Pill sold a boggling 30m copies - that's three times as much as the last Coldplay album - and Alanis Morissette has spent a decade trying everything to escape its shadow. She has appeared nude in videos, fired Ballard and presented the Canadian Juno Awards in a flesh-coloured bodystocking with outsized false nipples and pubic thatch. Most recently, in an attempt to shake her worthy, humourless image, she has starred in and co-produced her own sitcom: We're With the Band premieres in America this autumn. The advance publicity does not augur well. She explained her move to comedy thus: ""I think there is a levity that comes as I grow and hopefully mature."" Boom boom. If the sitcom doesn't succeed in putting Jagged Little Pill to the back of the public's consciousness, well, neither has anything else. Despite all the face-saving hoopla about 10th anniversaries and the necessity of reinterpreting ""timeless"" songs, Jagged Little Pill Acoustic smacks of weary resignation. Like Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells II and Meat Loaf's Back Into Hell, it doesn't so much play as fall out of the speakers with a flump: the sound of a towel being thrown in.
An air of pointlessness pervades the exercise, along with the softly-plucked guitars, gentle percussion and occasional Bollywood-influenced strings. Given that melodically pretty ballads such as Perfect and Mary Jane were acoustic to start off with, and that four other tracks (You Learn, Ironic, You Oughta Know and Head Over Feet) appeared in acoustic form on 1999's Alanis Unplugged, this album hardly constitutes a radical brainwave. Nor do the songs necessarily benefit from having their distorted guitars and booming drums stripped away. Taken slower, Hand In My Pocket loses its breeziness: lyrics that sounded cheerily flippant now take themselves very seriously.
In fact, the opportunity Jagged Little Pill Acoustic offers to closely examine the album's lyrics is one that you take at your own risk. While every song features at least one line so clumsy it makes you want to chew your knuckles off (""I don't want to be the sweeper of the eggshells that you walk upon"", ""There's no fundamental excuse for the granted I'm taken for""), the album's biggest hit, Ironic, features nothing but such convolutions. Like Dr Gillian Mckeith of TV's You Are What You Eat, it achieves the impressive double feat of sounding unbelievably smug while making absolutely no sense at all. There is something tiring about the constant haranguing: of her ex-lovers, her parents, rivals, friends who fail to measure up, her childhood priest. ""Is she perverted like me?"" asks the album's most famous lyric. ""Would she go down on you in a theatre?"" You start to wonder if the line stands out not because of its shock value - even 10 years ago it seemed tame compared to the lurid suggestions of female rapper Lil' Kim - but because the image it conjures up involves Alanis Morissette having to shut up for five minutes.
There is something instructive about hearing Jagged Little Pill Acoustic. It highlights how rock music has changed in the decade since the original album's release. For all the songs' radio-friendly sheen, you can't imagine them selling 30m copies today, not least because of Morissette's voice, an octave-leaping nasal whine that, at moments of high drama, becomes an octave-leaping nasal whi-hi-hi-ee-yine. In addition, female singer-songwriters now cleave to the Dido model. Mainstream audiences like their distaff misery and solipsism to come with a cosy edge, and however calculated Morissette's music or verbose her lyrics, her anger is hardly cosy. That doesn't make Jagged Little Pill Acoustic any fun to listen to, but it poses some intriguing questions. One is about shifting public taste. The other is about where a woman, who was the biggest star in rock not that long ago, now fits in."
neg,"Without the blue-eyed soul conviction of the original, it's enough to make even second-tier grunge has-beens like Seven Mary Three seem like innovators."
neg,"They cook up an almighty storm, but as winds go, it's rather hollow."
neg,These hammerheads still sound like the touring company of Grunge-a-Mania. 
neg,"Forty-five seconds into ""life on Display,"" Puddle of Mudd's second major-label album, singer Wesley Scantlin announces he's ""drowning in a pool of misery."" While most bands would spend more time working their way up to such a histrionic confession, it's par for the course with the Puddles, who specialize in third-rate grunge retreads stuffed with overdriven guitars and generic rock-dude melancholia. The only attempt at subtlety or nuance is ""Change My Mind,"" which could have been an outtake from an Alice in Chains unplugged album. Though Scantlin yowls his pain about his place in the universe and girls who don't understand him, the predominant emotion transmitted by these tired, hookless tunes is a kind of skull-banging numbness. The extra d is for dismal."
neg,"Puddle of Mudd were one of the many neo-grunge bands that cluttered the American rock landscape in 2001/2002, ten years after Nirvana brought the sound crashing into the mainstream with Nevermind. Nirvana and many of their grunge peers flamed out rather quickly, because they were an underground phenomenon uncomfortable in the mainstream, where there were fans that liked the sound of the bands, not the sentiments. Which means that there was an audience for bands that replicated the heavy feel, including some vague angst-ridden sentiment, but left behind the unpredictability, weirdness, and art of the first wave of grunge bands. Several post-grunge bands came close in the immediate aftermath of grunge, but nobody perfected it until Puddle of Mudd and their ilk came along ten years later. Puddle of Mudd were fortunate enough to work with Andy Wallace, the man who mixed Nevermind, and on both their 2001 debut, Come Clean, and its 2003 sequel, Life on Display, he manages to recreate elements of Nirvana's sound, but only if they were a plodding heavy metal band instead of a noisy, art-punk outfit. Which means they can occasionally sound like Alice in Chains, but where that band had deep metal roots, Puddle of Mudd's vocabulary begins and ends with grunge. What makes them different is that they're grunge for frat boys, nowhere more so when they're singing about relationships, where every word is infused with roiling misogyny. That was especially insidious on the previous album's ""She Hates Me,"" which turned ""Lithium"" into a drunken, clumsily profane singalong, and harbors one of the nastiest lyrical sentiments this side of Fred Durst (who, not entirely coincidentally, signed the band to his vanity label). That sentiment carries through on Life on Display, as Wes Scantlin lets loose with the charming accusation ""I'm afraid you're f*cking somebody"" on the chorus of the opening track, ""Away from Me."" His clumsiness as a lyricist emphasizes the banality of his songs, and while that could rile on Come Clean because he did write some catchy hooks, Life on Display is bereft of hooks, and glides by on its polished revival of grunge, so it's merely kind of dull. Without the hooks, Puddle of Mudd is revealed as what it is -- a pedestrian neo-grunge outfit that never grasped either the idiosyncrasies or the big picture of the sound it used as its blueprint. They skated by the first time through, due to a couple of fluke catchy songs, but they have no hooks or full-fledged songs this time around, and suffer dramatically because of it.

pos,"Neat Stuff ! Talk, Square one , A Message and Fix You are the highlights of this album. White Shadows sounds edgy in more ways than one . Go Listen.."
pos,"This album deserves much better than its Metacritic rating. First off, the New York Times' ""Look At Us Playing the Contrarian"" review skews the results unfairly. Secondly, the critical reviews of X&Y tend to be either of the ""it's too perfect"" variety or along the lines of ""it never soars like previous albums."" As for the former, that's just a ridiculous ""criticism"" that doesn't even make sense. If it were not ""perfect,"" they'd slam it for being poorly produced and would be only too eager to point out its flaws. As for the latter, like any Coldplay album, this has to sink in for a few listens. These are songs that take a while to get under your skin and sink their teeth into you. But once they do (and they will), they don't let go. This CD has been in constant rotation since I got it. A great, big, anthemic album as good as anything they've ever done."
pos,"excellent album. some cheesy sappy moments but nonetheless to be expected from coldplay. and really, how can one be upset that coldplay's lyrics are too sentimental and sappy, they've pretty much perfected the mid-tempo ballad, that's like complaining that ac/dc use too much electric guitar. this is an ideal album for fans, but is unlikely to sway new listeners, but considering they sold 13 million albums last time, keeping their massive fan base is all they really have to do."
pos,A fantastic album. Eighteen months well spent by Coldplay. What If and A Message are the standouts.
pos,"Super album, but you'll have to hear it 3 times before realizing how good it is !"
pos,I just bought this and it is the most beautiful thing since OK Computer.
pos,"I've always thought Parachutes was the better of two albums, and now I thinkits the better of three albums. Its an excellent disc but no song on there sticks in my head like Sparks or Clocks"
pos,"I will give those who dislike this album this: many of the songs on this alubm are very similar to those on 'a rush of blood to the head'. But hey, their first album was good, and this one is all that much better! I find it mixes ballads with more edgy songs well, and the lyrics are really well written. Every single song sounds like a Coldplay song, yet they are all so different. Coldplay stays true to itself and put out one hell of a record. If you liked their previous stuff, you will sure to love this."
pos,Intelligent. Intense. Introspective. One the best albums released in the last twenty years.
neg,"Every touch of lyrical bitterness is followed by enough sugar to mask the taste, which might be good in the short term but isn't a recipe for long-term health."
neg,"It's the music you can enjoy between meals without spoiling your appetite, made by the world's favourite band and hand-built by robots. Lipsmackin', thirstquenchin', acetastin', motivatin', goodbuzzin', cooltalkin', highwalkin', fastlivin', evergivin', coolfizzin' Coldplay: Designed for living. Engineered for life.

Doesn't your home deserve Coldplay? It's a good question. They've been making good things taste better since 1996, and their fifth studio album sees them straddle the globe like golden arches, connecting people, bringing people together, any time, any place, anywhere. It is, to be honest, a remarkable skill, and Mylo Xyloto proves that Coldplay haven't lost any of the ability to manufacture a soaring melody and a sense of community that they first exhibited on their debut single for Fierce Panda, the cutting edge indie label that, around the same time, bequeathed the world Tiger, Embrace and Ultrasound. So powerful is the feeling of unity that the band generate that it's almost impossible to hear a single track here without imagining the sound of a crowd roaring at the recognition of a song's opening chords: listen to 'Paradise', where a dramatic, string-accompanied introduction (artfully conceived, one can't help feel, with Later... and a quartet of female violin players in slinky black numbers in mind) tumbles into a synth line borrowed from Air's 'Kelly Watch The Stars' like it's a kid being dropped off at the pool. Listen to the way the acoustic guitars of 'Major Minus' are interrupted by the fierce chug of an electric guitar (brilliantly conceived, one can't help feel, with Johnny Greenwood's 'Creep' riff and a blinding wall of white lights in mind). Listen to how the powerfully titled 'Us Against The World' starts out all quiet, a pretty arpeggio painting equally pretty patterns in the night time sky, before Chris Martin sings in his commendably polite fashion that, ""Through chaos as it swirls / It's us against the world"" (touchingly conceived, once can't help feel, with drunken, forgiving hugs in cold, muddy fields in mind).

Music is art, but muzak is science, and Coldplay are technicians of the highest order, not so much writing songs as building grand monuments to the 21st Century out of the detritus of modern day life. Listening to these eleven songs ? and the three short instrumental sketches that are most likely the result of what the album's press release calls ""enoxification and additional composition by Brian Eno"" ? is like watching a car commercial that's 45 minutes long: it's masterfully directed, packed with the latest technology, full of gleaming surfaces, awash with inspiring scenery, and blessed with both the sophistication and convenience to which our world aspires. Passion is Coldplay's passion ? seriously, Mylo Xyloto tugs the heartstrings like it's dragging a sofa upstairs ? and this is as deep as a luxury bathtub from Homebase.

Its opening 43 seconds (the title track, it turns out) call upon the epic sound of Sigur R¢s, the delicate sound of a xylophone twinkling like distant stars amid a golden sunset of effects-drenched guitars, before ? feel the power of their acceleration! ? they launch into 'Hurts Like Heaven', an uplifting gallop that, with its sly reference to Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', acknowledges the band's debt to whose who have commanded arenas before them. 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' (a line so compelling it's also employed in 'Paradise') meanwhile starts out like it's a Europop anthem, but this, it turns out, is less an attempt to capture the Europop market as a canny method of reflecting the lyric's references to the communion felt in nightclubs at the weekend: ""I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song / All the kids they dance, all the kids all night/ Until Monday morning feels another life"". To their even greater credit, they then throw in the kind of bagpipe guitars that haven't been heard since Big Country went of 'East of Eden', and a breakdown that would land most B-list celebrities in the Priory."
neg,"Big big fan of the first two coldplay albums, some of the third and maybe a couple of moments on the fourth. This album seems to follow the trend fairly well. Chris martin is clearly a talented song writer and put a hell of a lot into the earlier work, and once the success hit his focus fairly abruptly changed from writing great songs to creating concepts and imaged, and trying to be this third world ambassador, at which point his head has become as big as bono's and everything sounds completely washed out and average. I hope this lazily written piece of mediocrity flops as to bring him down to earth, but the reality is it will be very successful and chris martin will continue to pollute our listening spaces for years to come"
neg,"Just terrible. I loved the first two Coldplay albums and half of the third album. I honestly shake my head when I hear glowing reviews of this album. The lyrics are trite, the music is boring. The production is good, but with a multi-million dollar budget I could make just as good an album. And that's not bragging."
neg,"I checked this out at the recommendation of a friend and I was really annoyed, they must hate me because every song seemed to grate on my nerves. What a huge disappointment from the world's biggest band."
neg,"Insipid ""music"". This is far from being alternative rock, actually this is very mediocre pop. Rihanna? Seriously. They just can't get any lower than that. It'll definitely be their worst reviewed album and one of the worst of the year. Too bad. I wouldn't buy this if I were you."
neg,"Mylo Xyloto is a huge disappointment. Yes, it is terrific production, but other than the single, ""Paradise"", Chris Martin's songwriting is surprisingly weak and the album lack the cohesion of ""Viva La Vida"". It's a foray into cheesy contemporary pop and electronica. Growing musically is great, to latching on to a genre that creates worse music than they do is a huge mistake. As a Coldplay fan, I think I'll pretend this album never happened and hope Martin goes back to putting songwriting first on the next one. Here, it feels like he's scraping the bottom of the barrel."
neg,"Definitely not as good as their earlier albums. The single Paradise is catchy and even Every Teardrop is all right, but the so far fan favourite, Charlie Brown, is dull and definitely not living up even slightly to any of the praise it's gotten. I stopped liking Coldplay after X&Y and this did not bring me back."
neg,"Somewhere under the layers of bleeps and bloops that make up Coldplay's allegedly ""more acoustic"" fifth studio LP -- the oddly titled 'Mylo Xyloto' -- there lays some form of melody and emotion... or so one would assume. If you are struggling to distinguish it also, you should instead move on to trying to spot the 'concept' weaved into the lyrical tapestry; this concept being -- rather bland and uninspiringly -- a tale of two lovers (named Mylo and Xyloto) trapped in the unforgiving streets of Urbtopia, finding comfort only in the arms of each other. This is as far as the 'concept' (and I struggle to name that, with confidence, to something so trivial) goes, plainly because it isn't followed with enough interest by Martin's songwriting.

That being said, what did Martin actually write? Elements of 'Every Teardrop...' are admittedly -- and shamelessly -- sampled from ""I Go to Rio"" by Peter Allen and Adrienne Anderson; whereas ""Princess of China"" (which features Rihanna, by the way) is accused of plagiarism from the song ""Chanting at the Alley"" by Vietnamese singer Ha Tran. Not only this, but the rest of the tracks are more like 'spot the influence'. The only predominantly acoustic track, 'U.F.O', takes ""Lord I don't know which way I am going/Which way the river gonna flow"" right out of Bob Dylan's 'Songwriting for Dummies' book, while the penultimate number 'Don't Let it Break Your Heart' nabs the scale and power from U2's back catalogue. Surely if your inspirations bleed through as much as they do by the time you have made your fifth studio album, your musical credibility must be questioned?

I feel a little remorse actually, since you can say quite confidently -- using the 250-or-so words above -- that I think Mylo Xyloto is the worst album ever made -- but I really don't. Coldplay have made a fan-pleasing record here, and this is evident by the other reviews on this website. You could argue that Colplay fans have the musical knowledge of a teaspoon, but take it from this Teaspoon -- this is as about as good as modern pop gets, even if it is aimed at (practically, no offense) scum"

Yes 5 albums in and Q magazine are still loving the Coldplay, ""Music this uplifting, this inspirational, belongs among the stars"" they say, well it belongs somewhere and it's definetly not the stars! I read such tripe open mouthed almost stunned that an actual music magazine can buy in to this rubbish and tell it's readers to waste their money. "
neg,"Definitely the worst Coldplay album so far. Only a few songs are listenable. It is a break from their usual style, but it is too far of a break. In Viva la Vida, Coldplay changed their style, but it made sense. This album is simply too far away from what we're used to from Coldplay. Also, the album doesn't seem to fit together. Viva la Vida told a story, Mylo Xyloto is a mess."
neg,"Coldplay definitely goes for mainstream silly pop in this record. Songs are simplistic and sound artificially composed. There's no emotion or inspiration in this album, it's just a collection of perfectly crafted hit parade tracks. The production of Brian Eno adds nothing but an excessive grandeur to this annoying mess."
neg,"The San Diego rockers haven?t completely reined in their runaway libidos on Slick Dogs and Ponies, but they stray from the devilish attitude that made their brazen dirty talk such a riot."
neg,"Sick Dogs never coalesces into anything more than the sum of its noisy, jagged parts."
neg,"Aside from a handful of tunes, little here is all that memorable, namely because the hooks can?t see their way clear of the repetitive, robotic arrangements."
neg,Louis XIV has a considerable amount of work to do for listeners to regard them as more than aimless glam-rock fetishists.
neg,"Psst, I don't know if anyone knows this yet-- it may not even be on Wikipedia-- but Louis XIV love to fuck, and apparently they often do so. Just listen to their music. Or read their lyrics. Or look at their album art, watch their videos, play their records in reverse, expose their press releases to an ultraviolet light source, or-- well, you get the point. Oh yeah, they also occasionally play rock'n'roll, which I hear is this style of music with an accentuated backbeat or whatever, but that's only to receive inspiration to fuck more. So now that that cat's out of the bag, we turn to follow-up Slick Dogs and Ponies, where apparently the sex sometimes goes bad, or at least grew boring enough to force our lotharios into trying new tricks.
While I hesitate to call Slick Dogs's night vision sex tape cover ""deep"" or ""poetic,"" following their debut's asscrack-on-bathroom-tile smut, it looks like a freakin' Van Gogh. Fittingly, Louis XIV try pretty hard to pass as artists here, as opposed to distilling classic rock libido into something you can simply inject in your ass. Frontman Jason Hill expresses some pathos here, a tad more profound than the pain of getting an erection while wearing tight jeans, but not far off. For an even crazier conceit, the band decides to actually work for their self-appointed sex symbol status, whether via Electric Six-style stabs at lunkheaded disco or big, dumb, ultra-schmaltzy morning-after ballads.
Single ""Air Traffic Control"" gets some sleazy mileage out of the aviation metaphor (""Well you were high when I met you""), but overall the track sounds like an unironic plea for help, especially when Brian Karscig's chirpy vocals kick in: ""Air traffic control/ I've been gone, I've been up away from home/ Now my gear is down, I'm circling round, and I am coming in."" The hushed psychotic thriller ""Stalker"", a surprisingly subtle, clever song, almost encroaches on Gorillaz territory, with Hill doing a pretty spot-on Damon Albarn impression. Of course, the band hasn't been properly neutered, and they're up to their old shenanigans on piss-drunk stompers like ""Misguided Sheep"" or ""Guilt By Association"", the latter announcing, basically, that they're scandalous enough to implicate anyone of breaking the law who's in close proximity to them.
Sadly, while Wal-Mart and Christian censor groups will bristle at these obscene sounds and images, there's really nothing uniquely shocking about Louis XIV, just disgusting or, even worse, plain dull. If they really wanted to ruffle feathers, they'd be championing ideas like ""global warming is a myth,"" not graphic but predictable sex romps or even the half-assed Iraq War rants on ""Free Won't Be What It Used to Be"" (""March out, soldier, the bugle calls""). The sentimental dimension of Slick Dogs only further depicts Louis XIV as an embodiment of everything American audiences just never ""got"" about glam rock. They're dazzled by the hedonistic aspects of the genre-- the (heterosexual) sex, the drugs, the big guitars-- but completely overlook the more complicated nuances. There are no sci-fi or fantasy themes explored here, and certainly no gender-bending. Instead, the slightly more dynamic Louis XIV only give you testosterone-fueled rock at its least appealing extremes: heedless lust or, arguably even more repulsive, cheesy balladry."
neg,"Though more adventurous than 2005's ""The Best Little Secrets Are Kept,"" the band's sophomore LP, Slick Dogs and Ponies, still rings soulless at its core."
neg,"Louis XIV has redefined the ""hate it or love it"" atmosphere with their 3rd studio album. There are parts that I loe and there are parts I absolutely hate. If I loved some parts you are probably wondering about my score, but let me tell you when it gets bad it gets BAD. I am a sucker for rock ballads and I think Louis XIV has done a pretty good job changing their sound. Now when listening to this effort you would think that misguided sheep have better direction than these guys. Their stoner rock sounds feels overblown and the music almost sounds like they are covering themselves. The underground indie roots of most of their music is just watered down like Kool-Aid without sugar. Sometimes you just want to stab your eardrums while listening to this other times you want to write apology letters to whoever actually spent money buying this. The music ranges from ear bleedingly awful to slightly above average and it is hardly ever the latter. The is not what you expect expect from San Diego rockers as it reminds me more of Sick Dogs than anything else."
neg,"I wouldn't agree with the piece of shit comment but it is a pretty bad attempt at jumping on the Jet bandwagon. I loved Air Traffic Control which is what made me buy it. However, after several tries, I have failed to understand how an American band can sound so British. Most of it sucks. I would recommend downloading ATC from Itunes or something and saving your money."
neg,"This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. The only people who would defend it, don't want to admit they wasted their money on this awful album."

pos,"im a huge fan of coldplay and i will have to say that my heart still belongs to a rush of blood... some of the songs on that album were the ones that bound me to this band and so its hard to really listen to x&y without comparing some of the songs to those of the two previous albums espically AROBTTH... i also think the lyrics werent not as well written but some of the songs on x&y are absolutely incredible - some of my faves are fix you, what if, square one and although swollowed in the sea is bland i still find it very nice..coldplay was definitely under a lot of pressureand was expected to fulfill all expectations from fans and critics alike.. but whats important i think is that they put heart into these songs and if you listen to them they really come to life "
pos,"On the very first listen, I thought this whole album was crap. Uninspired songs that reached for past greatness but failed miserably. After the 3rd or 4th listen, you relaize the intent and purpose of this album..to subconsciously bludgeon you with hooks and melodies and lyrical trite and imagery so catchy... that you cannot help but revel in its triumphantness! Serioulsly, the ends of White Shadows and Fix You may be some of the most over the top, wishy washy heartfelt crap ever spewed, but damn are they amazing moments! I still think tracks 9-12 are album filler, but this is a very solid album...not ROBTTH great, but nothing to be ashamed of. I guess you can say I agree with what the NY Times critic said, but I love this band so I don't mind being so melodically played."
pos,"X&Y is not the album I hoped to hear from Coldplay. It is a quantum leap better. Just as A Rush of Blood to the Head far exceeded Parachutes, so does X&Y far exceed its Grammy-dominating predecessor. ""Sound of Speed,"" with its immediately familiar feel, led me to expect more of the same (which is what I wanted, actually), but even that song turns out to be more complex than expected. Like the most recent U2 albums, with craftsmanship that only comes with months of work, this album needs to be listened to several times. The songs may not grab you outright, like ""Clocks,"" but when they finally do, they soar beyond places Coldplay has ever been. Chris Martin is at his peak, and this stuff is going to rock in concert. Critics who were too quick to judge this masterpiece will soon realize they knocked one of the great albums of the past 20 years."
pos,"It is great, all the songs are amazing!"
pos,"I love every song, especially square one, white shadows, and talk. Sure, it's not too far from their other two albums, but I love the other two albums. They are sticking to the same formula that made them successful and I'm glad for it. Another fantastic Coldplay album that i can listen to over and over again."
pos,"X&Y is just what Coldplay needed to put out. Sure it didn't reinvent the wheel, but as Chris Martin says it did put new rims on the old wheel. Johnny's guitar playing ha gotten more bold, the songs are chock full of passion and it's a perfect follow up album. Love it so much, and probably won't stop listening to it for a month. Can't wait to see the boys in August in Jersey."
pos,"I am addicted to this album. It will be on repeat for the next month, I'm sure. Absolutely beautiful."
pos,"Absolutely fantastic. I love everything Coldplay has ever put out, and this is no exception. The whole album plays so well together and is incredible. I loved it.This is 1 of the best albums i've ever heard and anywho has anything bad to say about it is terribly wrong."
pos,"I was going to give this ten, but i would give Rush ten and this isn't as great as that is, it's very good though, i was the same as another user, didn't really like to start with, but after repeated listenings, the songs have really grown on me, square one, white shadows, (love that guitar), fix you, talk, X&Y, low, (my favourite) and twisted logic, they are all quality songs and get better with every listen, great album!"
pos,"This is one of those records that takes more than one listen. The first time I listened to it through, I didn't really get it all. It didn't seem as good as ROBTTH. But after more listens, I find it to be a masterpiece. Like it or not, this is the album Coldplay will be remembered for."
pos,"The main criticism many reviewers were making about ""A Rush of Blood To The Head"", despite rave reviews, was that Martin and the band still sounded too mellow. Coldplay have taken those words to heart here in this most guitar-driven effort to date, ""X&Y"". The U2/Kraftwerk-esque crunches drive a number of songs including the raw opener ""Square One"", ""Talk"", ""Low"" and ""Twisted Logic"" forward, while 80's techno blends drive the impressive ""White Shadows"". ""Fix You"" takes off where ""The Scientist"" left off, reaching a climatic point with the gospel-esque vocals chiming, fading off with Martin vocalizing as though he's preaching to the choir, making it their most empowered ballad yet. And the ""hidden"" track ""'Til Kingdom Come"" makes a stunning closer to the record, acoustically-driven and one of Martin's more deeper writes. It's forgivable that Martin may come off as schmaltzy and soft on some latter tracks of the record, particularly ""Swallowed In The Sea"" and ""The Hardest Part"". The record is more slickly produced than their previous efforts, and we have seen Martin evolve a great deal in his personal life grappling with the issues of family with Gwyneth and his daughter Apple, along with dodging tabloids. Whoever rated this lower than ""Parachutes"" (The New York Times) have already discredited themselves here. The more sensible argument is whether ""X&Y"" is superior to ""A Rush of Blood To The Head"" or not. I believe ""X&Y"" tops both their previous efforts. Indeed there's still room for improvement (let's hope Martin is non-pretentious enough to keep the band together and give it another try) but, ideally, ""Parachutes"" was like the musical blueprint to the band, with ""A Rush of Blood To The Head"" musical architecture in the making, and ""X&Y"" putting soul into what they have built from scratch. "
neg,I agree that this album was a huge let down compared to the freshness and energy they displayed on their debut album.
neg,The CD made me feel like a piece of shit wrapped in tin foil! I would rather be molested as a child by Micheal Jackson then ever listen to this CD again.
neg,This is hands down the worst music piece ever! it was so bad it gave me cancer and made my ears bleed!
neg,"Absolutely awful. After the remarkably brilliant tone of their first album, this feels forced, disingenuous and completely flat. One or 2 songs almost catch your ear but this band has either sold out, or traded their bravado for estrogen pills *yack*. Stop trying to change with the times and do what you are good at"
neg,"Absolute trash. How he could, in good faith, release such garbage and ask people to pay for it is beyond me. Wayne's dropoff is complete. If you thought his past few albums were dreadful, wait until you listen to this one."
neg,"Lil Wayne's decline as an artists continues with this project, I make no exaggeration when I say this is the worst album I have heard in a very long time. Everything in this album is lacking from the mixing to the actual writing of the album, everything sounds so bland. There is not one track on this project that I can honestly say is a stand out song or that gives me any sort of hope that Wayne will get back on track. With this project, Lil Wayne has hit an all time low, with terrible lyricism, unfunny puns and a recycled subject matter this album deserves no more then a 2/10. The production was the best part of the whole album but even that became very repetitive as all the melodies sound almost the same. In the end, I wouldn't suggest this album to anyone, hopefully the reception that this album brings will wake Mr. Carter up."
neg,"Never has the saying 'fell off' properly used then here. This is one of the worst albums of the past 10 years. From an artist who sold platinum albums and singles, since Tha Carter III, either he's lost his ghostwriters or fame has gotten to him. The production is also all over the place. he needs to work hard on his albums, and if Tha carter V is his last Album, he needs to make sure its not like this."
neg,"I hate agreeing with what the critics seem to be saying, but this album is trash. Seems as though there was no thought in it, as if it was done in one day and distributed the next day. Wayne's past albums are all nearly classics, this doesn't even compare. Maybe with the record label, guest appearance's on other's tracks, and all the other things is catching up to the artist. Which would be a shame."
pos,"Coldplay can still create good music, make a homogenous record and write lyrics with the same glorious, Buckley-esque sentimental drunkenness, but it doesn't stop where ROBTTH knew it had to. Some things are taken one step to far (an example: 'Fix You' does not carry on the legacy of 'The Scientist', it's just too pseudo-emotional), and for the first time I see myself questioning some of the production. All in all, many songs seem to follow a formula, less seem based on the intuition of the band members. This is Coldplay trying to live up to grandeur - which never works, just ask U2. Not quite as easy to listen to, and lacks outstanding tracks, in particular the opening an closing tracks, which are no match for 'Panic'/'Everything's Not Lost' and 'Politik'/'Amsterdam'"
pos,"brilliant. Don't forget that 'A Rush of Blood...' took a while to sear itself on our brains. The same thing is happening with X&Y. Bring on No. 4 when you are ready, Chris."
pos,"It took me a while to get into at first. It wasn't a summertime album, but then I saw them perform many of th songs, and I got it. On the surface thses songs are deceptively understated, but with close listening, their similarities are peeled back to reveal layers upon layers of differences and beauty. The one swelling end does somewhat redeem it. Standouts include: Talk, Square One, Speed of Sound and White Shadows."
pos,This album rocks! The songs there are just so soothing! Those people who says that it isn't good does not have any taste! Th song For You is so soothing that it makes you feel 'high' and makes you feel like you are flying! Very suitable to listen to during airplane flights! 10 Thumbs Up!
neg,"Lil Wayne has never been the most well liked or respected rapper around and outwith his Carter albums, not much of a critic favourite either. So I was pretty shocked that this got so much as a mixed critical reception. This is such a bloated album with absolutely no substance. The opening track, IAMAHB, would have been amazing if it weren't for the awful lyrics. In fact, most solid beats are ruined by horrible lyrics. Every song is either bland or disgusting. The only good ones are Days And Days, Gunwalk and God Bless Amerika. If this really is his second last album, he's not on the right track to round off his career with a classic"
neg," can honestly imply that Wayne has put no thought or creativity into the lyrics of this album. He can recruit the best producers, receive the best beats, but just explain his limited knowledge of the female anatomy. For those who were expecting an insightful, lyrical album, you are sorely mistaken. However there are few highlights of this album such as the T Minus produced Rich as Fuck"
neg,"Truly one of the worst albums I have listened to, especially for a huge fan of all Lil Wayne albums since The Carter 2. It is as if Lil Wayne has completely given up on actually trying to maintain his contention for the ranking of ""Best rapper alive"" (if he ever was a contender for that), with the worst punchlines you will hear on anything besides a 2Chainz album, but not to worry 2Chainz fans, the baboon himself has a couple of features on the album where him and Weezy spit atrocious punchlines and wordplay hand in hand with each-other. Feature wise IANAHB2 is the polar opposite to his last studio album Tha Carter 4, from having some of the most prestigious and respected features including the likes of Nas, Busta, Tech N9ne, and the man himself Andre ""Ice Cold"" 3000 on the Carter 4, he is now collaborating with some of the most tragic artists to ever make it onto the mainstream hip hop scene such as Soulja Boi and 2Chainz. 
This album truly marks the death of Lil Wayne's career that I had tried so hard to deny and neglect before hearing this abomination."
neg,"Three to four decent songs (thanks to features) but the rest is just not good and at times unbearable. Unfortunately, there is no concept to it and most songs are about weed, pussy and skating. Plain boring and repetitive."
neg,"this album really disappointed i hv waited for best rap album from him in 2013 but it didnt happen 
the album is full of normal tracks and it has nothing special on it"
pos,very good chord progressions that rival the Beatles. The sound is not bland and the CD begs for me to play it again. Great lyrics and sound. Good love songs. What can I say!
pos,"This is Coldplay's best album. They have finally reached U2-like status with their lyrical content and musical styles. Best song on the album, ""Talk"" is also, in my opinion, the best song of 2005."
pos,"X&y is a cd very intersting, i recommend... ...the best Coldplay's cd... ...my song favorite is Fix You!! ...please Coldplay come to Argentina!"
pos,This album rocks! The songs there are just so soothing! Those people who says that it isn't good does not have any taste! Th song For You is so soothing that it makes you feel 'high' and makes you feel like you are flying! Very suitable to listen to during airplane flights! 10 Thumbs Up!
neg,The album is the worst mix of misused auto tune and idiot production. I Am Not a Human Being II lacks of inspiration now Lil Wayne has sold out. One of the worst album of the rapper.
neg,"A Lil Wayne album? Well it was awhile since he released Tha Carter III wich I think was pretty solid had some great songs in their, but after that it has just gone downhill for Wayne, album after album Wayne struggles to get one solid album together. The Rap/Rock album ""Rebirth"" went straight to hell with it's lazy lyrics and weak production. It was all off and probably one of the worst releases of 2010. Three years has gone since his ""Rebirth"", and since then Waynes raps has been still pretty mediocre. Now has the sequel of the better but still kind of meh ""I Am Not A Human Being"" anything to offer? No, as a rapper and lyricsist Wayne falls at it but as a comedian he sure was funny. ìMy tongue is an Uzi My dick is an AK My tongue is an Uzi My dick is an AK My tongue go, ëbrrrrrr,í My dick go, ëpow!í My tongue go, ëbrrrrrr,í My dick go, ëpow,í b*tchî he raps over the Soulja Boy produced track ""Wowzers"". 

All the way through he threws some weak ""shock"" punchlines about how great he is when it comes to sex. The begining, the end, it's SEX, SEX, SEX all over it. To be honest it gets boring after the third track really. The production switch things up at some points but still could not hold up for a whole album with it's ridicoulous rapping. The guest features were ok, Drake and Future did a great job to his third single ""B*tches Love Me"" a song I hated at the first 2-3 listens but since then grown on me. And the track ""Trigger Finger"" got Soulja Boy on it, and he produced it also... I bet you're not expecting a great verse from him? Not to say that his first two singles were mediocre at it's best except maybe... a good verse from Big Sean on ""My Homies Still"". Lil Wayne is not the best or the worst rapper, but not either one of the better around. When it comes to put an album out Weezy has lost it and man I don't know if he will ever release something solid outside his own little fanbase and make it listenable to other music/hip hop fans. 

""I Am Not a Human Being II"" is not great album as many seem to believe or even close to that. It's just Wayne rapping about his over some beat. Are you a Wayne fan then I don't think you will dislike this but for other listeners that's picky when it comes to lyrics then I don't see why in hell you would like this. You'll probably hate it. And I know that Wayne is not all about the lyrics, but the Wayne I know used to spit some clever lines. About three tracks I enjoyed out of 15, not enough to make up for a great album or even a good one. Yes, it could be fun to listen to Waynes over-the-top rapping, some might think it's cool. But come on, the dude has not released anything with great punchlines and lyrics that make you go ""hey that was fire"" since frickin' 2008, that year is over. 2013 has now got new rappers that has taking over, young and hungry cats with great sense of writing. Can tell you this, the 65 minutes of the album could have felt like some over produced Uwe Boll movie of a lenght about two hours at times. Like it or not, this is just not for me. Would never recommend this to people outside the ""YMCMB"" fanbase. I'm feeling a decent 3 on this, till his next project I hope Weezy shows that he actually is thrilled to be making a new album!"
neg,"As much as it pains me to say, judging by recent albums, Tha Carter III was a one-off, or Weezy is on too much stuff to be able to notice how truly awful this album is. Sloppy production, poor lyricism, and the only thing Wayne has going for him on this album is some half-decent features and the fact that, hey, at least it's not Rebirth. Maybe he can redeem himself with one last CD, one last shot to make an enjoyable CD with Tha Carter V, that will take us back to the days of Tha Carter III, Da Drought 3 and No Ceiling, but this is very much shown in my eyes that this truly is the death of Weezy. R.I.P. Young Money. 2/10."
neg,"Wayne is no doubt a highly talented artist, but I truly don't think he cared when making this. I wanna hear the hot verses and punchlines from Tha Carter 3 & No Ceilings. Not hearing dick & in every single song. I defended Dedication 4, but I can't defend this trash."

pos,"This is the only album of the year so far which has exceeded my expectations. Since the magnificent 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head', Coldplay have decided to modify their sound and the result is a fine collection of well written and beautifullly constructed tracks. 'Square One' and 'Fix You' are both spectacular and 'Till Kingdom Come' is a fine way to end an album. With the release of 'X & Y' Coldplay are right now the best band on planet."
pos,"While this may be a very successful record, it doesn't quite mak sense with me. The entire album sounds like some old B-sides that got some touch ups. Way too similar to their previous work, it's hard to distinguish them as anything new. It is obvious their trying a little harder, but do songs like ""Speed Of Sound"", and ""Fix You"" make it sound like they've made much progress?"
neg,"Other than the piano in the beginning there is nothing new about this release. Same punchlines, same crappy beats, and to make it worse EVERY LINE IS ABOUT dick 

The only thing abnormal and the only way I could even guess that he is not a human being is by how this album is. I don't think they make albums this bad!"

If that doesn't convince you of how bad it is try this: 2 Chainz actually had the best verse on the entire album."
neg,"So I turn on my new Wayne CD and my expectations are lower than dirt. The first track opens with a piano roll and I almost pass out because I figured Wayne might actually be doing something decent, or at least Carter 3 level. Then he started to rap... And it went downhill so quickly. Wayne has lost all credibility with me. This album, if you can even call it that, it's basically a Young Money v2 mixtape but Lil Wayne was in need of some cash. This album is about 3 things. Sex, drugs, and money. Literally that's it. Tracks I liked... there's only like 2, IANAHB, and Rich as Fuck. Other than that, this is terrible. Oh and by the way, what was with Soulja Boys WACK production on Trigger Finger"
pos,This is simply the best album i have ever heard. A cocktail of beautifull songs mixed with a strange sense of darkness that i have not heard since Radiohead's Ok Computer. It sends shivers through your bones. Breath taking!

neg,A very disappointing album from Wayne with just his crafty one hit punch lines and production that sound the same it just was not impressive. One of his worst albums besides Rebirth.

pos,"In places, there are predictable harmonies. However,Mark's metaphors, melodies, and talent that is all performed in a Techo, alternative, and pop style is just fabulous and it makes you ask about the earth and what is truly real through those interesting metaphors. My father, my mother, and I love this CD.( I live my parents because i am only 12 so I'm not an adult who unfortunately has to live with his parents.) i got it at best buy and it's worth $20.00 as opposed to $14.00."
pos,"I'm taking off a point for the generally un-noteworthy lyrics, and a point for a couple of lackluster songs near the end of the album. Otherwise, I think this album has that vibe I remember from Parachutes. The songs are evocative and the instrumentation makes them sound familiar and new all at once. Highly recommended. Just a note to those of you who think this album is derivative: Everything is! Stop ruining a perfectly good listening experience with your unreasonable expectations. Oh, and YOU try writing an album this consistent. Good luck with that, Superstar."
pos,"There are many great songs in this album, and I don't mind the ""progression"" with all those weird sounds but let's face it an romantic Radiohead will NEVER work, from X1 to Y6 it's a masterpiece but after that... the equation doesn't make the cut"
pos,"INSPIRING. Although AROBTTH still remains my favourite Coldplay album, x&y breaks new ground. You have to give it time to sink in and to get used to it, but when you do, it's worth it. Coldplay will always be my favourite band, with lyrics, creativity, and talent that I don't think I'll find anywhere else."
neg,Only listen to this album if you want to destroy your ears. A true disappointment I listened to this a couple of times to see if it would change my opinion and it didn't it made it seem worse. If I had listened to it once it might have scored a 2 but nope not even close.
neg,"The first few lines are a foreshadowing of the rest of the album. He honestly sounds like a sex crazed maniac. No matter what beat or what the song is about it comes back to d*ck in a p*ssy or p*ssy on a tongue, etc. The intro piano is so beautiful and the only thing he literally rapped about was violence and sex. I think he sat down and tried to make the most vulgar rap album ever. The best songs are mostly when he isn't rapping about sex on this album which is almost never. I'll lastly note how it's hilarious to me how Curtains sounds like an exact copy of No Worries! 

Highlights: God Bless America, Romance 
Meh: Love Me, My Homies Still, Lay it Down, No Worries 
Trash: THE REST OF THE ALBUM"
pos,"I think they could of done much better. Its still all right though, just not as good as the last ones.You still get some good songs, and is still a good buy."
neg,There is no shortage of bad ideas on the second installment.... But this ugliness is anchored by a series of largely curatorial successes.
neg,"Despite two potent blasts, ìGunwalkî and ìNo Worries,î the disc is both numbingly haphazard and inconsequential.
"
neg,"In an interview last week, Lil Wayne stated that he suffers from epilepsy ó the cause for the string of seizures that left him in the hospital earlier this month. Wayne is only just now sharing such a personal fact, ostensibly to debase the widespread claim (catalyzed by TMZ) that his seizures were drug-induced. Purple drank-induced, more specifically.

I wonít lie: When I heard the news of Wayneís hospitalization, the first word that came to mind was ìcodeineî. If weíre to believe Weezy actually lives the party-all-the-time lifestyle he brags about in his raps, then the guy is constantly sipping the sizzurp and sucking on blunts. It isnít farfetched to assume those intoxicants might cause a seizure ó or at least stunt oneís career. Epilepsy is affecting Dwayne Carter. Drugs are destroying Lil Wayne.

It wasnít so long ago when he was on top of the rap game. 2008: ìLollipopî was all over FM radio, and Weezy was dropping hilarious, wacko mixtapes seemingly every week. But ó slowly ó a prison stint, hedonism, and droves of younger, more passionate rappers have worked to dethrone Wayne. Heís releasing I Am Not a Human Being II with the dreaded ìhas beenî relegation looming over him.

And based on the albumís opener, youíd think heís aware of his fading relevancy. ìIANAHBî is a striking five minutes of Weezy riffing verse after verse to some impressive piano soloing by producer/pianist ELEW. Itís fueled both by sentimental angst (ìSometimes I need someone to talk toî) and Weezyís typical shenanigans (ìI stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids/Jose Cansecoî). The track is an unexpected blitz, and one of his more memorable recordings to date. It would appear heís back and with a vengeance. But no. None of the 14 tracks that follow ìIANAHBî match its tenacity or production values.

I Am Not a Human Being II descends into nonsensical party rap ó which isnít bad in and of itself, but itís the way itís delivered by Wayne and his comrades (including 2 Chainz, Soulja Boy, and Drake): lethargic, bored, and uninspired. ìIím strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law / See me walking with a limp / Thatís my gunwalk,î goes the hook of ìGunwalkî, a prime example of the content included here. Weezy picks a subject (what drugs to include in his ìtrippy bag,î how he is going to ìbeat the shitî out of that pussy, etc.), and then he and his guests rap about it.

But Lil Wayne is best when he rhymes disassociated shit ó so this pick-a-subject approach becomes restrictive, limiting his comedic range ó and without the laughs, heís nothing. Also, the beats. Where are they? I Am Not a Human Being II has plenty of trunk-shaking bass, but thatís about it: a handful of samples, a few snares, hi-hats, and lots of bass. The rap-rock fusion ìBack to Youî and old-school ìRich as Fuckî are the two exceptions here ó the latter featuring two 2 Chainzís finest IANAHB moment: ìLook at you, then look at us / All my niggas look rich as fuck.î

There are certain points of interest on the album if you look into Lil Wayneís lyrics, past the misogyny and ridiculousness. He drops subtle hints that things may not be so hunky dory in his sensational life. On ìCurtainsî, when he repeats, ìI ainít nervousî like somebody who is totally nervous and trying to convince himself otherwise. He does the same thing on ìNo Worriesî. OK, Lil Wayne, youíre not nervous. Nobody asked if you were. Why do you keep repeating that? Maybe itís just a search for some sort of meaning in his words, but he sounds like heís in denial.

He has the right to be in denial. He makes lots of money, and his career is on the downswing. Many have been in denial over that. For Lil Wayne, the solution is simple: Put some effort into the music, regain your momentum, and then reassert chart-topping dominance.

Effort. Just a little. This album has less than little. Lil Wayne is an aficionado of pussy-eating and doing lots of drugs, usually at the same time. Thatís all youíll learn from listening to I Am Not a Human Being Part II. The beats are so simple that theyíre a nonfactor, and there arenít very many funny lines ó which was Wayneís most redeeming quality in the past. The record makes one fear for Dwayne Carterís career in addition to his already unstable health. Hold it together, man."

neg,"Tha Carter III and the year Weezy was king are starting to feel like distant memories given the middling output the Young Money chief's been dropping on the world in the time since. New record I Am Not A Human Being II does little to break Lil Wayne's lengthy streak of mediocrity, and much of that is due to the man's increasing limited lyrical scope. The problem with reducing nearly every spoken phrase to an unrelenting string of rap metaphors (three quarters of which are explicitly sexual) is that very few MCs ó let alone this one ó have ever been that consistently clever or creative. The results are a few incredibly sporadic choice one-liners among a wasteland of repetitive dick and pussy references, and groan-inducing puns that become increasingly brain cell sapping as I Am Not A Human Being II progresses. Cuts like ""Beat The Shit"" and solo piano opener ""Ianahb"" offer a couple of musical life preservers, but when the best things about your guests are their name and trademark lead-in (that's you, 2 Chainz, bested here only by fellow invitee Soulja Boy in being a lyrical travesty), you're in pretty rough shape. While not an absolute mess, I Am Not A Human Being II isn't very good"
neg,"About a week ago, Lil Wayne fans around the world were reminded that their beloved rapper is, indeed, a human being. Primed to release the follow-up to his lukewarmly received I Am Not a Human Being (2010), Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr., was checked into the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on March 12th after suffering a seizure. The details of his visit and severity of his illness have been disputed by Cash Money Records CEO Birdman and the various tabloid websites that first picked up the story, but the whole episode regardless lends a morbid irony to the title of his new album. Lil Wayneís artistic message--nay, his entire persona--is abrogated by the details of his personal life, his chants of ìWe are not the same; I am a martianî cancelled out by the veritable truth that Lil Wayne and I are, at the core of our being, the same, except that Lil Wayne drinks way more cough syrup. Whether or not it seems fair, the manís career has been defined by a downward-sloping narrative that starts somewhere around 2008ís great Tha Carter III, this narrative a swirling hydra of drugs and Auto-Tune and casual trips to prison that seems to find its nadir here, with this album. I Am Not a Human Being II, its release symbolically coinciding with Wayneís near-death experience, is the sound of a rapper flatlining. 

Or is it"" The downfall of Weezy is a narrative that has been gamely challenged by his defenders (see: Calum Marshís review of We Are Young Money [2009] for Cokemachineglow) and by Wayne himself, who it must be noted has quietly released a lot of great material in the period apparently condemned to be his rock bottom (ìSwag Surfî"" Best song ever). Regardless of its quality (spoiler alert: bad), thereís something about I Am Not a Human Being II that feels almost like a victory lap. The syruped-up Auto-Tuned clusterfucks to which Wayne has assigned his name for about five years have suddenly become something of a commodity. Future, the up-and-comer whose head-scratchingly overrated Pluto (2012) molded circa-2009 Weezy into a cohesive vision, provides the hook to hit single ìBitches Love Me,î the hip novice helping out the veteran on an aesthetic they can agree upon.

All this means is that I Am Not a Human Being II is not the malignant abortion its contextual framework has it set up to be. This is not The End of Lil Wayne. This is an album of party music--a rapper in relaxed mode, going hard for a few tracks but soft on most others, riding whichever latest trends suit his fancy. That is prima facie okay; the album will generate the same wild range of opinions weíve come to expect from a Wayne album. Sadly, itís also a pretty boring approach, so much so that, indeed, I find myself wanting to write around the album than about it. Iíve never been a fan of the defense that a critical piece on a work of art should mirror some aspect of its subject, but finding myself shouldered with the task of reviewing this album, I must capitulate. Aside from its opening track, which Iíll get to, this album is essentially a blank space--synths gurgle, Weezy fizzles, an hour passes. ìWowzersî sees a typical effort from Wayne: ìMy tongue is an Uzi / My dick is an AK / My tongue is an Uzi / My dick is an AK / My tongue go, ëbrrrrrr,í / My dick go, ëpow!í / My tongue go, ëbrrrrrr,í / My dick go, ëpow,í bitch.î Or, from ìNo Worriesî: ìNow take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong / I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar.î On ìCurtains,î he ìfuck[s] the world, no condomî for at least the thirtieth time in his career. You get the idea. How does one write about something so compliant in being so braindead"" Wayneís wordplay has devolved from genuinely clever--even eye-opening, at its best--to just sort of smashing words and phrases together if they sound alike. ìPussyî is repeated so frequently that it loses its meaning as a linguistic unit. On ìTrippy,î the syrup practically dribbles from his mouth. 

This, of course, has always been the fiber out of which Wayne constructs his off-kilter vision of rap music. The fans still holding strong look back dewy-eyed upon Tha Carter II (2005), Dedication 2 (2006), and Da Drought 3 (2007), but we often forget that Lil Wayne was as relentlessly silly, even dumb, on those albums as he is these days. Thereís a difference, though: that silliness came packaged with an undeniable exuberance, an endless fascination the vernacular of rap and its multitude of convergences. Listen to the breathless opening lines of something like ìFly Inî (ìThey call me Mr. Carter / I kissed the daughter / of the deadís forehead / I killed the fatherî), and then, well, just about any track here. Once again, Iím loath to buy into a narrative that so neatly ties together Wayneís health problems and the trajectory of his music career. Even so, this album has left me scrambling for an explanation: why does every punchline, every synth twitch, every cunnilingus reference hit with a thud that feels so withering, so artificial""

Only one track from I Am Not a Human Being II is worth remembering, and that is its opener. ìIANAHBî is striking primarily for its production, a seemingly unrehearsed piece of grandiose piano that constantly evolves, never really looping. Itís ìQueens Get the Moneyî (2008) on steroids, undeniably ridiculous yet lending lines like ì90 billion bitches on my stick like a skewerî (yes: 90 billion bitches) an operatic power. What ìIANAHBî portends for Lil Wayneís career is unsure, given that its only connective tissue with the rest of the album is Weezy making silly puns about his dick. But thereís something undeniably fresh about it--itís the single track here that feels like the product of genuine effort. This being a sequel to an album that was rush-released before Lil Wayne was sent to jail, perhaps my expectations were too high. When the exception becomes the rule, however, and each album elicits in me and many others only a sighing ìwell, maybe next time...î, the disappointment becomes deafening. This is probably not Wayneís fault but mine; you canít expect a rapper who lives so recklessly to maintain any kind of consistent output. Human Being II nonetheless arrives as a particular kind of letdown--the kind that comes when you realize that someone you admire and respect is, after all, only human."
neg,"
The possibility that Lil Wayne's new album could be overshadowed by his recent health scare is confirmed by this rote, crass reassembly of what once made him great. Weezy called II ""my bum-ass album"" on his release from hospital: turns out he wasn't just being self-deprecating.

The title is sadly accurate. Lil Wayne is a full-blown cottage industry now, a one-man corporation that provides succor and service to careers ranging from Nicki Minaj and Drakeís to Gudda Gudda and Lil Chuckeeís. With this many shareholders come obligations, so despite the increasingly obvious and pressing personal needs of Dwayne Carter the man, Lil Wayne Inc. steamrolls forward, impervious to setbacks. When Carter landed in the ICU for six frightening days this month, after seizures that many assumed were related to his ongoing, years-documented problems with codeine addiction, his handlers smoothed things over with the panicked dissembling of hangers-on propping up an ailing dictator. After his release, Wayne gave a thumbs up to TMZ cameras to allay fears, announcing he was ìbetter than good.î He did look good, but he also, tellingly, shrugged and offered this: ìMy bum-ass album is coming out... March 26? It's 26?...Youíre gonna get that shit or you wonít. If not, itís whatever.î

This spirit of indifference hangs heavy on I Am Not A Human Being II. In his review of 2011ís Tha Carter IV, Ryan Dombal observed that ""after an epic run, it seems as though Wayne has finally run out of inventive ways to say he's on drugs, or great at sex, or extremely interested in making money,î and two years later, the prognosis has only grown more grim: No song on IIis meaningfully distinguishable from the next. Everything pumps out in an undifferentiated slurry of interchangeable dick jokes, drug references, and lame puns. Tha Carter IV moved nearly a million copies in a single week, and this staggering success may have sealed Wayneís artistic fate.

All of the quirks and peculiarities that once made Wayne great have hardened, six or seven years later, into nearly unbearable tics. All of his lyrics have devolved into barely rearranged little puzzles of themselves, with countless versions of his ""She ride/ Take this dick like ___î formulation, none of them funny or creative: On ìIANAHBî, a woman takes it like ìadvice,î while others ride it like both ""go-karts"" and ""the Kentucky Derby"" on ""Curtainsî. His tweaking of gangsta-rapís language has never been more perfunctory. He sounds terminally bored, and even the better rap songs on here-- the hits, like the Mike Will Made It-produced, Future-and-Drake-featuring ìBitches Love Meî or the rubbery, Bay Area-influenced clap of ìRich As Fuckî-- work around him, not with him.

The only moments where Wayne sounds marginally interested in his own music come when he veers furthest away from rap. On ìRomanceî, he sings in his croaky, limber way about his profane version of love while Cool & Dreís synthesizers smear like bionic fireflies: ìShe kissed my ankle when I twist my ankle/ She even did anal when she don't do anal.î On the big, clomping pop rock of ""Back To Youî, his voice is a shpritz of Lil Wayne on the surface of a towering club-pop production, the kind that mashes together the respective sugar highs of Euro club-pop, hair-metal, and synth pop into a glutinous ball (If youíre wondering whose sampled voice that is crooning at the bottom of all that mess, by the way, itís Jamie Lidellís.) This might not be the most promising future to ponder for Wayneís music, but theyíre the moments he sounds happiest: as a cog in a much bigger machine than himself, set free from being the all-consuming center for the first time."
neg,The results of his recent output have been unquestionably subpar.
neg,"There was a time when New Orleansí Lil Wayne seemed invincible. His 2004-í08 run of albums and mixtapes made an all-swagginí, snarling superstar of the Cash Money rapper, muscling his way out of the Louisiana hip-hop scene into the charts and onto Obamaís iPod (ìHeís got a pretty good flow,î the US President smiled in 2009). Three years, one prison stint for gun possession and some serious musical missteps later, including 2010ís lumbering ëTha Carter IVí and singles with í90s guitar has-beens Weezer and Limp Bizkit, Dwayne Michael Carter Jr is looking pretty human after all. Just ask the staff at LAís Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who last week treated him for life-threatening seizures reported to have been caused by an overdose.

All that hasnít stopped him returning to the herculean message of 2010ís ëI Am Not A Human Beingí on this sequel. But Wayneís 10th studio album sees memory of his charisma and sparkle during that mid í00s era fade further. Though he still spits with the same southern flow and flair, songs such as ëTrigger Fingerí and the unintentionally hilarious ëRomanceí (ìthe best part of waking up is breakfast after a napì) find the 30-year-old sounding uninspired and uninterested, the chilling growl and imaginative Auto-Tune of hits like ëGot Moneyí replaced by tired punchlines and lazy hooks.

Itís not all bad ñ the albumís deluxe edition sees Nicki Minaj rediscover the dirty sneer of her 2010 verse on Kanye Westís ëMonsterí over ëLay It Downí, a remix of TNGHT tune ëEasy Easyí, and there are reliably exciting productions from Dre and Juicy J to explore ñ but itís hard not to want more from a man who claims to be so superhuman. ìLast night I dreamt my dick turned to Megatronì, Wayne confides on opener ëIANAHBí.

pos,"After waiting 3yrs and all the hype leading up to the new albulm, I was expecting more. The 3rd album is a pivotal in a band's development and longevity. (Think of U2's release of War and the impact of that album) I generally like all the songs, although I feel some were dragged out a bit too long (something that works in a live concert but not necessarily on the the studio version (ex. What If i think should have been a couple ""oooh's"" shorter)) Also, releasing Speed of Sound as the first single, may have raised expectations even higher, but arguably the smoothest track on the album, it may lead to the next singles not having the same intensity. In the album's defense though,each listening session improves the songs, as songs that appearred to be lackluster start to catch on and you end up really enijoying it. The next test is to see how these songs translate live. With the guitar work on this album, I'm anxiously looking forward to it."
pos,"Like Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head, this album is front loaded with some amazing stuff. Then, just like their previous efforts, the recede into some pretty mediocre stuff. Despite this pattern, the front of this album is so amazing that everyone who liked Parachutes or Rush of Blood should pick it up. The best tracks are Talk (simply amazing stuff), What If, and White Shadows."
pos,"I have been an avid Colplay fan for quite some time now, and I was greatly anticipating this release. However, after bringing it home and listning to it twice, I felt that it was a bit too sparse in it's great moments, especially after an album like Rush of Blood. Coldplay needs to stop trying to appeal to an ignorant majority of idiot teeagers, and concentrate on making real art. Though it was a let down, it still maintained that sense of asthetics that we all know and love as Coldplay. Most of all, I look forward to what will come next, will they keep engaging in becoming part of the MTV machine? Or will they take the ""Kid A"" approach. We can all hope for the latter."
pos,"I have never been a huge coldplay fan, i will not deny the intensity of their hits, (ex. yellow, the scientist, clocks etc.) I own parachutes, which i have never much liked and AROBTTH which i enjoy, but rarely. However X & Y is one of the top 5 records I have heard released in since 1999. i am floored at their ability to mix all aspects and create such a beautifully blended masterpiece. Those disappointed incertain aspects of the album should attempt to see the final product for what is, a heart felt ballad album with phenomenal rhythm. I am truly floored."
pos,"I can not stop listen the whole album since i got it, I think is the most remarkable job of the band.... specially Talk."
neg,"Have you ever seen something so profoundly beautiful as a ìmoth butterfly thingî? Kanye West has, and he was so struck by its symbolic integrity that he had DONDA, his creative content company, incorporate it into the cover art for Lil Wayneís 10th studio album, I Am Not a Human Being II. According to Wayne, Kanye ìchose the moth butterfly thing because it has so many different stages of life, and it goes through so many forms and changes, and no one can figure it out, and itís always beautiful.î Obviously, weíre meant to interpret this in terms of his career ó the metamorphosis from Hot Boy to mixtape phenom to established solo artist to ìrock starî and, finally, to his current artistic incarnation: an Auto-Tuned, Pac Sun-styled combination of the above. And yes, just like the beautiful moth butterfly thing, we will never understand just who Wayne is, artistically and personally. Just as weíll never understand the complex choreography of monarch migration, we can never hope to comprehend the forces of money and/or nature that took us from ìI Feel Like Dyiníî to something that actually made us feel like dying.
Of course, the beauty of these feathery insects stems from their brevity (the average butterfly lifespan is a mere two weeks). We recently saw this aspect of Wayneís moth butterfly-ness manifest itself, when he was rushed to the ICU after experiencing a series of violent seizures purportedly caused by over-consumption of sizzurp, his nectar of choice. During those tense few days, the media made it seem possible that I Am Not a Human Being II would be the rapperís last album. Thankfully, Lil Wayne has pulled through, and weíve been spared from the terrifying prospect of posthumously immortalizing this as his last artistic statement. But while the tension and confusion have passed, we are unfortunately left with a pretty disappointing piece of work. As my fellow writer C Monster eloquently puts it: ìOH, cool. New Lil Wayne still sounds like a robot yelling at you for an hour.î
What is he yelling at you about, you might ask? His penis, basically. Wayne doesnít just make dick jokes: he sets a Guinness World Record for the most phallic metaphors in any rap album, ever. Over the course of the albumís 15 songs (18 in the deluxe edition), Wayne compares his member to the next black president, Megatron, a serpent, a recliner, a chair, morphine, a kangaroo, steroids, a rocket, a NASCAR, a shovel, breakfast in bed, a piÒa colada (penis colada), an AK/47, horse, a pony, and a unicorn (there are undoubtedly others that Iíve overlooked; can you spot any hidden gems?). Granted, Wayneís crazy free-association skills are one of the reasons we fell in love with him in the first place; his uncanny ability to jump from Orville Redenbacher to the Bible to Bad Boys in the span of a single song is one of rapís national treasures. But on I Am Not a Human Being II, itís just one lame-dad punchline after the other, peppered with Trukfit product placements and tired rhyme schemes: ìShe kiss my ankle when I twisted my ankle/ She even did anal when she donít do anal,î he croons at one point during the painful ìRomance,î his voice buried in Auto-Tune. Itís amusing, yes, but in a cringing, Soulja Boy kind of way (speaking of Soulja, he inexplicably appears as a guest rapper and producer on this album ó twice; his slapdash snap beat for ìWowzersî sounds like something a middle schooler could cook up in the computer lab).
When heís not trying out for the headlining slot at a comedy club for 15-year-old boys, Wayneís either going through the hollow, cliched motions of gangsta posturing (ìGunwalk, ìTrigger Fingerî), trying his luck at the rock star thing (again) and failing miserably (again) (the Jamie Lidell-sampling ìBack To You,î ìHello,î ìHot Revolverî), or animatedly drawling his way through decidedly safe pop jams (ìCurtains,î ìBitches Love Meî). Sometimes a marked, stoned giddiness shines through the monotony of tracks like ìNo Worriesî and ìTrippy,î and you can practically hear Wayne cracking up to himself in the booth; itís a nice taste of classic Da Drought Wayne, and provides just enough energy to keep things from being a complete travesty. And still, such moments are all too often overshadowed by the stupid self-seriousness of songs like ìGod Bless Amerika,î in which the rapper muses on the big questions, trying hard to keep a straight face: ìI saw a butterfly in hell today/ Will I die or go to jail today?î
I can just see Weezy now, standing on the Cliffs of Dover, skateboard in hand. Slow motion pan to the flames. A butterfly moth thing flits away into the inferno and a single tear rolls down his cheek, tracing the same path as his infamous tattoos. A somber piano riff, an ollie off the precipice, and finally, a plummet into the the world of Limp Bizkit guitars, dick jokes, and ìbreakfast after a nut.î It feels a lot like trolling"
neg,"The music isnít as good as it was, sure, but whatís truly maddening is his apparent indifference to his own decline.
"
neg,"Isaacsís indistinct, flannel-waving wail doesnít add anything to these titanic anthems of soul and struggle, which donít say much beyond: Dave Navarro, still breathing, still taking meetings."
neg,Sounds a lot like a collection of rejected Foo Fighters tunes.
neg,"Perhaps the worst aspect of ONe is how on autopilot the band sounds. Even the flat-out rockers ñ like the opener, 'Teahouse Of The Spirits' ñ contain no guitar pyrotechnics and come off sounding limp and perfunctory."
neg,Could pass for a load of Stone Temple Pilots B-sides.
pos,"Coldplay has done again a remarkable job. For those who do not like this album, I must tell you that this is not easy listening music. You have to hear the songs many times to start finding the appropiate sour to the songs. Follow my advice, hear many times, find the sour and you will see this album is going to be amazing to your ears. Enjoy!"
pos,"this is an album that takes a few listens to really like. im not a huge coldplay fan, but i liked a rush of blood and thought id check it out. some of the lyrics are kind of lame like ""i want to love you but i dont know if i can,"" but the melodies were beautiful and i coudnt get them out of my head. this is a great listen!"
pos,"Ostensibly, X&Y is a triumph. Every second sounds sublimely good, but sometimes that alone cannot merit greatness. The album lacks the poeticism that ""Don't Panic"" and ""Yellow"" lent to Parachutes and the Instrumental glory found in A Rush's ""Clocks"" and ""In My Place."" Martin's lyrics are unforgivably stilted. How could the line ""The tears come streaming down your face"" be written by the same man who wrote ""I was just guessing in numbers and figures."" Then again, why can't I stop listening to it? I guess the real tragedy is in how good it could have been. Twisted Logic is the CD's best. "
pos,Overall good album with many good songs that martin some makes sound different and each in their own way enjoyable. Although it did take some time i was pleased with the album
pos,"A fantastic album from start to finish. Sure they are sticking to their formula, but I loved their previous albums and I love this one too."
neg,"The pallid sound of early-í90s English indie-rock ó noisy, angry, searching for direction in the years between grunge and Britpop. The coruscating ìAnyone Can Play Guitarî and the ubiquitous weirdo anthem ìCreepî suggest that better will soon come.
"
neg,"Utterly un-inspiring, dull, with weak pretty-boy lyrics. It dumbfounds me the amount of critical acclaim this band gets. If it weren't for Radiohead head this boring, musically vacant fourpiece would be back washing dishes."
neg,"Collins... sounds dated with his glossy production, precision session-playing and radio-friendly songs all done by numbers with a great big hole where a heart should be."
pos,I am officially in love with this album... although in my eyes it doesn't beat Parachutes i think it's genius and i don't understand why people give feedback if they hate the album.. here's a plan if you don't like it don't listen to it and stop trying to ruin it for other people!
pos,Wow! I think those who critic this album might be crazy! This is by far the best album ever! Even if you might not listen to it on radio stations quite often.. X&Y offers great songs from the greatest band.. COLDPLAY!
pos,"Was disappointed for the first few listenings. Put it down for a week. Picked it back up. Got stuck on Square One for another week. Then really listened to the whole album - now I find I can't stop listening to it. Every time I listen, I hear more -- I might even make my husband a Coldplay fan!"
pos,"Hands down, this album is most underrated Coldplay album ever. X&Y earned so many commercial success but this isn't enough for this album. Every tracks on this album are very good. More guitar riffs, more meaningful lyrics written by Chris Martin."
neg,Middle-age is no excuse for such an unforgivably bland collection of over-emoted love songs.
neg,Testify really doesn't work.
pos,"Coldplay were trying to find something new during the whole album just to find out that the best songs of the record (""Fix You"" and my absolute coldplay favourite ""Speed of Sound"") were written using pretty much the old formulas of their last album"
pos," I love this album, the best coldplay album, i love the sounds, and lyrics, i love all of the album, the best coldplay album, for ever."
pos,"I still think this is their finest effort yet. First they wanted to be Radiohead and then they wanted to be U2 (the band said it themselves), but I believe they came into their own on this one. Sure, there are hints of Joshua Tree throughout. That doesn't need to be said. Well, maybe it does. I wonder if Chris Martin has ever written a song better than ""Lovers in Japan""? I doubt it. Great album. Their best yet. "
pos,"I think this album is a masterpiece and is definitely underrated. Some really beautiful songs like ""Death and All His Friends"", ""42"", ""Cemeteries of London"" and ""Lost"". I really could name any song. There are no weak ones that stand out. Coldplay strikes again
"
neg,The usual drivel from this self-centred whinging old git.
neg,I used to like Phil Collins. Then I heard this. It sounds like Manilow.
neg,"The sound of Phil Collins in this album can best be described in the South Park episode ""Timmy 2000"". This is a man who has been inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame and is one of the most talented musicians. Whether he was in Genesis or solo he was one of the best drummers, singers, and songwriters in the business. Yet, he managed to create one of the worst albums I have ever heard. It may not be the worst, but certainly top 5. In between the Tarzan and Brother Bear soundtrack Phil Collins released Testify, which is one of his worst selling for a reason. This album just reeks with lack luster, for instance, I have heard several songs b the name of ""The Least You Can Do"""", but this one sounds just like all the other songs in the album. All the tracks blend together as one long adult contemporary wave. Each song alone does no harm, but together they fuse into a Phil Collins cesspool of subdued nonsense . Thru my eyes this is the worst work of an all time great. It's not too late in Phil Collins career to have another comeback, however, this should be a wake up call to fans that he is not the same unique and energetic person he use to be. The way the songs were structured was driving me crazy. Just look at all the other reviews of this album to testify my statements."

"
pos,"One of the most beautiful, and lyrically/musically significant albums I've ever heard, 'Viva La Vida Or Death & All His Friends' is a must for fans of Alt.Rock//Experimental Rock. The album from start to finish has a clear, crisp sound, differing from their previous style of long progressions of semi-melachonic chordal structures. From the Napoleon-esque 'Lost!', to the eastern styled 'Yes', and to the euphoric ending, 'Death & All His Friends', this is truly a remarkable album, resonating so many themes of war, love, beauty, death, hatred, faith and hope. The album itself resembles the cyclic year of seasons, with the 'Summer' songs like 'Yes' and 'Lost' contrasting with the 'Winter' songs 'Violet Hill' and 'Cemeteries of London', but perhaps the best thing about the album's structure is it's consistency, and never ending cycle of music as the last song, 'Death & All His Friends', links to album's begining, 'Life in Technicolour', in a beautiful fashion. Coldplay have really outdone themselves this time - there may not be your crowd pleasers like 'Fix You' and 'Yellow', but the album itself is solid proof that even in the 21st century there is still beauty in music, and most importantly a meaning behind the song. Absolutely, without a doubt, their best album so far"
neg,"On his new disc the veteran of populist trance shows himself unable to come up with anything remotely innovative or engaging, even for the dance floor."
neg,"It's trite, but Paul Oakenfold's 2006 effort could be a contender for dance album of the year, if the year were 1997. That may be fine for his hardcore fan base, but it's strange to think the man who was on the edge of mainstream dance music for so long isn't offering the next big thing anymore. Making this even more frustrating is the fact that albums of new productions are rare from the man -- mix CDs make up most of his discography -- so one would think A Lively Mind would be a grander statement, especially with its ""you get to look inside my busy head"" title. Dropping these expectations, and the expectation that the star-studded and smart guest list is going to bring the innovation, the album is satisfactory, and even exciting in parts. Two electro stompers -- one with actress Brittany Murphy on sex kitten vocals -- pass by before the album loosens up and finds an exciting groove with the disco-fabulous ""Sex 'n' Money,"" featuring vocals from Pharrell Williams. Williams' minimal vocals might as well have been a sample of anyone with a cool falsetto, but unbelievably, the legendary Grandmaster Flash's contribution is even smaller. The two other tracks of note are instrumentals. ""Praise the Lord"" gets campy and offers a Latin-flavored beat with a Duane Eddy-styled guitar, while ""Save the Last Trance for Me"" is an epic track that builds to a shuddering climax, something Oakie excels at. Some serene, wide-angle numbers toward the end help a lot, making this safe album easier to recommend to the longtime trance addict.

neg,"Skrillex and Diplo successfully serve up twitchy beats ready to incite anything with a pulse, but the sentiment at the albumís core leans toward insufferable."
neg,HORRIBLE album..all songs sound the same..repetitive beats and justin's 1 octave vocals really dull and unimpressive. Justin can't sing let alone make music. The 1 point is for Skrillex and Diplo
neg,"I had to force myself to listen to this record. Thatís just how boring it was. To be honest I thought this guy was done for in the music business but he came back with ëPurposeí. 

To start of the record he starts by waling out a melody through ìnahís and dunsî. Then a mellow trap-like beat plays accompanies him while he sings meaningless and generic lyrics about living a lie called ëMark My Wordsí. 

The third song on the record, titled ëWhat Do You Meaní was a big hit before he released this. I honestly donít mind this one song besides the piano and the clocks. It just doesnít fit the song at all. The lyrics are crap but what do you expect from JB? 

A few more boring song later ëNo Pressureí comes up which features rapper Big Sean. The lyrics in this song seem to have the same theme as ëWhat Do You Meaní (running out of time, making up your mind). Then Big Sean comes in with his monotone voice. I thought it was interesting that he mentioned Yoko Ono in the song. 

A few other electronically processed and computer generated lyrics later comes ëWhere Are ‹ Nowî which features Skrillex and Diplo. The verse sounds Skrillex-like with JBís filtered voice. Then the beat drops in normal Skrillex fashion and itís actually not bad. The melody is pretty good and everything but of course Skrillex made this song and Justin Beiber didnít. I thought the horn could get kind of anyoing sometimes during my second listen of this song. 

The next song is an EDM-like song titled ëChildrení and heís talking about making a different. When the beat drops I actually had a smile on my face because it wasnít bad a all. 

Lastly, the final song ëPurposeí starts off with a sad piano vibe. Then he starts singing some more generic lyrics. After listening to this record and almost falling asleep (twice) besides the few tolerable tracks on album I think it was just boring and unoriginal."
neg,"I mean, the album is good overall, but we can't deny that 80% of the songs have the same rhythm, I'm not a fan of ballads but the ones on the album are the best part, anyway, it doesn't cease being a basic record."
neg,"Another terrible album, generic music, junk lyrics (not written by JB) and horrible voices, Justin is just a pretty face for the teenage girls, and not a musician as he likes to call him."
neg,"I was so excited for this album until I heard it. It's a Justin's album or Skrillex? It sucks! The only good song there, is Sorry and just because it's catchy and that's it. He's trying way to hard."
neg,this album just consist of cheap edm music nothing special and all these songs sound same and same rythm nothing new things on this album just terrible
neg,"it's so bad, it sounds repetitive, I didnt enjoy it while I was listening to it, I expected more for this album, this album sucks. I'm so dissapointed,"
neg,"well, I will tell you the truth: this is the worst album of 2015. Don't buy it, it is not worth it. Reflection and Revival are better than this album"
neg,"All the songs are so similar ... Some of them are cute but, I don't know there's no point in making an album if you're going to use the same sound in half of it? I gave 1 just because I think ""life is worth living"" is a good song, the rest of them are just boring."
neg,To me this proves that Justin is improving from his earlier albums but it still isn't good enough he should be producing brilliant albums but instead he bores me to tears and I put something else on.
neg,"Bad album that isn't made out of passion. It's made so he can get more tattoos, and pay his out standing charges and fees from the bad stuff he committed."
neg,"electronically processed and computer generated lyrics. ''Children'' save this album a little, but it isn't enough. Dissapointed on how much the people consider the diverse ways of electronic like music, don't matter how much you say it, it is not. The electronic is a bubblegum, and the biggest example is ''sorry''. that song sound like ''how deep is your love'' by calvin harris so much, a little mainstream lyrics, electronic beat and caribbean, ew. Love yourself is not bat at all, but like children, is not enough. The singles excited me about this album, i was expecting more."
neg,"All the songs are the same. Same beat same style same everything 
I would like to hear different sounds and different vocals for certain songs but there's none so to me I would rate 4 out of 10"
pos,"Coldplay is the band that gets bashed by every indie biased critic (Pitchfork, The Guardian, The Idependent, Mojo, etc), hated by hardcore U2 and Radiohead fans and mocked by common music listeners (Family Guy, 40 year old virgin). These reasons cause them to have the worst reputation in the world of music asides from Nickelback of course, but the Canadians is a whole different story and well deserved. 

So it was in 2009 when I bought the album. I've only heard Viva La Vida on the radio, but everytime I heard it, it was only portions of it. At that time I was more of an Oasis fan, and hearing Coldplay getting overplayed and getting all the grammys created a slight of jealousy and bitterness in me towards them. I was starting to jump on the bandwagon of Coldplay hate, but thank goodness out of the nowhere I decided to give Viva La Vida a try. 

Lol, my brain was hooked right at the first listen. This might not be better than AROBTH (as far as acclaim from music critics), but in my opinion, Viva is equal and sometimes sounds better. The freshness of the sound is what makes the album to stand out from its preceed. I can hear the influences of U2 in songs like Lovers In Japan or the wooah's in several of the other tracks, but the atmosphere of the sound feels so unique. Throughout the album, you find orchestra with echo sound/noise in the background, the church organs, and all these oriental instruments that bond the songs perfectly like a family where each track is related to each other. Moreover, the songs don't feel overproduced and long like in x&y, which makes the album so pleasent to listen from beginning to end. 

Coldplay also managed to incorporate the melancholy for which they are known for (mostly mocked for). Hear songs like ""Lost!' or the ballad, ""Strawberry Swing"". These are alongside Viva La Vida, the best highlights of the album. ""Lost!"" in particular, is the one that stands out. The church organ with the hip-hop-like beat is difficult to not like just as it drops at the beginning of the song, and then comes Chris Martin with the line: ""just because I'm losing, doesn't mean I'm lost"" in a melancholic tone, turning the melody even more irresistible. So, irresistible that made me think and ask myself, ""so why they hate Coldplay again?"". I was this close to jump on the bandwagon, but this album made me a fan of their music again. I already was a fan, and thanks to them I discover new bands like Oasis, Blur, Radiohead, U2, The Verve, among others. Basically I got into real music when I discovered Coldplay. 

Well I told my story and my more importantly my OPINION on this album JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MUSIC CRITIC, and my intentions are not to make you a coldplay fan, but at least to make you ponder the next time you type comments like: ""You know how I know you're gay?"", .""Pitchfork said that..."", ""They are the water down version of ___"" which are pretentious attempts to discredit the band."
pos,"fantastic work,war,peace,love,hate,darkest coldplay album and the most experimental album since parachute.I would argue this is Coldplay's finest album aside from Rush of blood to the head. A much more relaxed, soothing vibe that is sharply contrasted from their other albums. Feels like they aren't trying to stand out with any of their songs but just create great sounding music."
pos,"This album is amazing! It's pretty much the epitome of variety. Also the songs aren't ""typical Coldplay"" They're all really different than previous albums yet they still retain the feel of Coldplay songs that we know and love. It's a must buy!"
pos,"Everyone gives so much praise to A Rush of Blood to the Head, but in my opinion it's only second best when compared the other albums of Coldplay. Viva la Vida has more great songs and the entire theme is more in depth and complete. I don't think their is a single song on this album I don't like. Their future albums will have a pretty tough time matching the great talent shown in this one."
pos,"Wow! My favorite Coldplay album has to be between this and X&Y. This album is just fantastic. It is subtly a concept album, as it deals with life and death and the duality that exists between those two. It's just superb. It's a little brighter than previous albums but still has that Coldplay-esque vibe to it. Such a wonderful effort. I think I actually like every single song on the album, save for one or two. I wish Coldplay would have continued making gems like this, but sadly, they fell off after this, with each release progressively worse. "
pos,"I love this album, and Coldplay seriously benefitted from the production of geniuses like Brian Eno and Jon Hopkins. Every track is good in some way. Best Coldplay album."
pos,"Masterpiece. The album delivers a fantastic rock with a very satisfying Colplay'ish type of alternative. No song in this album is even average. Lyrically, Coldplay is terrific in Viva la Vida. except talking about love only they discuss War, Hatred and ... relatable yet complex. Some brilliant tunes and guitar works. The record carrys a very high quality. Songs like ""Viva la Vida"" still the best of Coldplay or ""Violet Hill"" and ""Cemeteries of London"" and all others. This remains the best of Coldplay"
neg,"Reasonable material, boring voice as always, annoying middle -sounding however sounds cool at times , strong compositions , and the contradiction sounds strong this album when ""Love yourself"" says not wanting to his old love , and ""sorry"" says he wants Selena right back , reasonable material. kinda cool to"
neg,the album also takes itself so seriously that too often it inadvertently suppresses exactly what made Bieber so appealing in the first place.
neg,"is always the same with this new generation, all that occurred, are not very many songs with good lyrics, but has a silver lining in all this is that for fans"
neg,"This is a bubble gum teen album. This is a Reflection 2.0 just made to hit and he forgot the quality. He is so focus to get the #1 thet forgot to do a good album. Forget Selena, she's movin' on and is happy now. HER ALBUM IS BETTER THAN YOU"
neg,"I did not enjoy this album. Hate to say his songs mostly sounded the same, but they did. I was expecting so much more from Bieber, I honestly think he might've been better in his My World/My World 2.0 era. The songs are too electronic for me and the hype for this album was way too much. The whole ""comeback"" story his PR made was extremely smart, considering he never actually went away, but everyone loves the comeback kid. Of course Bieber's voice is incredible though, it always has been. Giving him a 3 rating only because his vocals are insane."
neg,i think the problem here tht this albums his best the first time the focus is makin sense unlike previous he could actually produce an easy version of oxymoron or gkmc where he can talk issues his life the purpose wht fame did but its lack and the lyrics sucks jst cause a gd voice doesnt mean good shit justin work with frank hes a one of kind he is one of the best gd voice and soulful works tht touch on things so justin we need proper your best but still weak people wake up 
pos,Experimentation pays off. I wish more mainstream bands would try new things like coldplay do here. Beautiful album from start to finish. Coldplay have officially secured their spot as one of my favourite bands.
pos,This album is near perfect! An epic sonic journey with celestial music. You will be flying with every track. Superb!
pos,"I would argue this is Coldplay's finest album aside from Rush of blood to the head. A much more relaxed, soothing vibe that is sharply contrasted from their other albums. Feels like they aren't trying to stand out with any of their songs but just create great sounding music."
pos,"A very good album that I am enjoying more and more. I would probably rank Violent Hill the weakest song. A great album to listen to from start to end with some nice instrumental tracks. At the end of the day, this is a pop album that should appeal to their huge fan base."
pos,Amazing concept album.
pos,"Coldplay's best album to date sounds like a swirling mess of Brian Eno at first, but with repeated listens you can hear the greatness and you're left with easily;y the best album of the year so far...quite a masterpiece."
neg,"Go ahead, blame Wiz Khalifa. Casting about for some kind of hook delivery system to anchor Furious 7ís lugubrious elegy ìSee You Again,î the guy who once apologized for sucking alighted upon Charlie Puth, a sad-eyed lad of the Pinelands equipped with a falsetto soon to set grown men blubbering in multiplexes nationwide. Aided by a video eventually topping one billion-plus views, the tune perched stubbornly atop Billboardís Hot 100 for twelve weeks, and thus the Teflon-voiced Puth became a star. ìSee You Againî wasnít much more than a slow, sentimental ooze, but this fella clearly had pipes, and showbiz hustle dictates you introduce yourself to audiences By Any Means Necessary. Still, the newcomerís followup didnít suggest an artistic visionary ready to testify. Another duet, this time set alongside the feckless Meghan Trainor, ìMarvin Gayeî proved a low-heat ode to high-heat passion, about as edgy as a Broadway revival cast recording and featuring one of the more dubious name-verbing exercises in contemporary pop since BeyoncÈ let Hillaryís husband off the hook on the gown-all-Lewinskyíd line off ìPartition.î

But weíre getting ahead of ourselves. Because look, Charlie Puth has arrived, with his very own album ready for purchase, and heís been working on this thing like you wouldnít believe, writing some stuff, producing some stuff, even calling up Shy Carter to see if he had a little free time to swing by for a guest verse. (Shy Carter, unsurprisingly, did have a little free time to swing by for a guest verse.) And as a full-length presentation of the manís creative convictions, itís perfect, in a way ó sleek, slow, totally anodyne. Nine Track Mind is the kind of pure pap wholly appropriate for a clear-voiced Nice Guy who first carved out his artistic ambitions (letís just quote his deadpan Wikipedia bio here) writing ìintro jingles for the videos of the Vlogger family the Shaytards.î Sounds pretty dreary to me, but I suppose in our post-YouTube creative economy itís about the equivalent of being a Neil Diamond roadie.

But onto the voice! Puth lives and dies by his falsetto abilities, which are slightly endearing and employed without relief. For better or worse, that tireless slide into the upper register is his musical personality. Weíre not in Timberlake or even Bieber territory here ó limiting our musical parallels strictly to the competition Puth deserves, Nick Jonas is Stevie Wonder by comparison and the Cash Money-vetted teenster Austin Mahone is West End Records-era Peech Boys.

In fact, the historical example which might best approximate all things Puth is the long-forgotten jazz/pop footnote Johnny Pace, another sweet-eyed Jersey boy who got his shot at the big time thanks to hipster patronage (Chet Baker playing the Wiz Khalifa role), and whose sole album arrived in 1958 bearing gifts of tasteful white balladry before dropping out of sight. Donít get your hopes up, though ó Puthís got way more than one album in him. Heís no mere hack: jazz piano major, Berklee grad, knows his way around a mixing console, even professed his love for the production work on Steely Danís notoriously knotty Pretzel Logic to some L.A. Times profiler ó relatively highbrow stuff for somebody palling around with the likes of M-Train.

Still, donít expect cerebral jazz-boogie supporting esoteric rhymes. The big idea here is ballads, lots of them. Thereís oozing ballad ìLosing My Mind,î tweedling around in the same stale vein as ìSee You Again.î Thereís the ballad that halfheartedly toys with breaking into a jog, ìSome Type of Love.î Thereís vaguely retro ballad ìSuffer,î which might serve as a warning to the unwary. Plus, thereís big old ballad ìOne Call Away,î which finds Charlie inexplicably boasting how ìSupermanís got nothiní on me.î Also sorta-scary doom ballad ìDangerously,î in which our hero does battle with a nefarious minx who manages to both tie Puth to the railroad tracks and transform herself into the oncoming train (the M-line perhaps?). And there are a few other ballads, too! In fact, the most standout feature of Nine Track Mind might be its rhythmic consistency, an exercise in deceleration which will come as a relief to those Sam Smith fans distrustful of that bruise-voiced croonerís occasional excursions outside the valley of the torch song. When Selena Gomez finally swings by for her relatively upbeat duet feature (a breezy poolside whiff of coconut water entitled ìWe Donít Talk Anymoreî), the mild change in tempo risks bringing on decompression sickness.

all the inoffensive dross of Nine Track Mind ó which amounts to one thing you can do with a degree from Berklee I guess ó the vexing ìMarvin Gayeî is at least worthy of being deemed a genuine irritant; leaving most of the worst lines to M-Train, who as youíll recall has journeyed far from her ancestral Nantucket homelands to return booty to a beleaguered nation. Try as they might, two glasses of skim milk batting eyes at each other and joking about dogs looking for bones canít tarnish Mr. Sexual Healingís legacy. Still, the track remains so simpering that one canít help but wish for some kind of court-mandated restitution for Charlie and Meghanís genteel defamation of character. As the hapless Robin Thicke knows only too well, the Gaye estate retains excellent legal counsel."
neg,"there are 12 tracks on Charlie Puthís debut album Nine Track Mind, which is either three or 12 too many. But no matter; the album is a smoothly executed pitch deck of exactly what will perform on pop radio in 2016, and Puthópronounced ""Pooth,"" and the slice through his right eyebrow is from a childhood canine attack, if youíre wonderingówill do just fine. The 24-year-old Berklee College of Music graduate and former YouTube star of the acoustic-cover variety has already had three top 40 singles, all since last February: first, the demonic Meghan Trainor duet ""Marvin Gaye,"" then, the Paul Walker Memorial Beanie Baby track ""See You Again"" (featuring Wiz Khalifa), then ""One Call Away,"" an ocean of syrup that sounds exactly like ""See You Again,"" and is the first song on the LP.
Charlie Puth is extremely talented, it must be said. Thereís that Berklee degree, of course, and the fact that he wrote so many theme songs for famous vloggers before he signed to Atlantic. Puth co-wrote every song on Nine Track Mind and produced much of it solo, and the songwriting and the arrangements and the engineering are shockingly proficient, proficient to the point of insensation. Also, there is Puthís voice, a beautiful tenor/falsetto soaring out of a throat that never coughs that frog out and as such must be magical. In other words, Charlie Puth is a truly excellent product, the type of artist that inspires wildly confident emails from anyone getting a cut. ""Wrote the hook in 10 minutes,"" you can imagine his A&R tapping out on an iPhone (Puth did, he says, for ""See You Again""). ""Videoís going to be just Paul Walker clips and the Wiz verse, guaranteed smash, gonna do a billion on YouTube."" And it did.
Like the best-selling (i.e. blandest) model home in the up-and-coming suburb, Nine Track Mind is demoralizingly well-constructed as a means to an end, and itís because of Puthís considerable abilities, and not in spite of them, that the album induces such despair. It doesnít help that Nine Track Mind is all ballads except for three tracks, two of which are duets (Trainor, a sleepy Selena Gomez) that somehow still feel like ballads. Puth cannot fill this frame of sentimentality with any genuine sentiment: The albumís emotional range covers the spectrum from light longing to light infatuation, contributing to the overall sense that Nine Track Mind is aimed exclusively at hairlessness: children, prepubescents, the discomfitingly waxed.
As he showed us in ""Marvin Gaye,"" Puth lives for retro flourishes: doo-wop rhythms, sock-hop melodies, finger snaps, arpeggiated singalong piano. The album doesnít deviate much from this safe spot; when it does, it goes blander (""Up All Night"" is completely self-effacing) or, pleasantly, Ryan Tedder-er (""My Gospel"" is a nicely rumbling One Republic facsimile), or, even more pleasantly, somewhat close to Justin Timberlake territory. ""Suffer"" is a credibly lustful piece of pleading, and ""Losing My Mind"" begins with a lovely, distorted Timbaland-lite riff that rings like a bell over Puth, who gets to take a welcome break from his falsetto. The latter track sounds like the work of an award-winning college acapella group; it is the albumís strongest track.
As for the rest? ""Left Right Left,"" a love-ish song that sounds like accidentally holding hands with a coworker, is a ballad that assumes no one will listen to it. If you did, youíd hear Charlie Puth encouraging his romantic interestó""Weíre almost there, baby, one more step""óto bravely overcome the obstacle of Charlie Puth, who is dealing with a set of problems that includes ""walls,"" ""long roads,"" and ""climbing."" There is a classic track in the So Sweet The Neg Will Be Invisible genre (itís called ""Then Thereís You,"" and the chorus goes ""Thereís beautiful and then thereís you""). There is also a series of increasingly unnecessary vows scattered throughout the album: Puth promises to save the day, to never sleep alone, to stay perfectly still when the world is on fire, and then, in ""My Gospel,"" he goes nuclear. ""Iíd stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on and walk out with a million bucks,"" he blusters. ""Then Iíd burn it in a pile out on your front lawn, just to prove it didnít mean that much.""
That lyric couplet has the approximate relationship to joy and meaning as the rest of this album does, generally. Later in the same track, Puth promises to ""carry your body to the top of the tower to kiss your lips at midnight."" What a tempting offer, and a typical one, in which your best case scenario is unconsciousness. Youíd have to be completely sensible to pass."

neg,Every song on this album is worse than See You Again and that's a shit accomplishment. I mean you have to be on another level of shit to be able to do that.
neg,"Absolute dredge. This album just plods, and plods, and plods along. The most exciting segment is when Selena Gomez shows up for a sleepy cameo. This really could have used a shot in the arm and more than just two uptempo tracks. 'Left Right Left' might be some of the most pedestrian writing I've ever heard. A few of these tracks would work better if they weren't surrounded by 7 other tracks that sound identical to it. 
Do yourself a favor and avoid this."
neg,"Ew... very basic, I hoped a lot more from this artist, total dissapointment. I guess at least he tried with that song See You Again, which if is his only good and recognized song, It is sad for a talented person to become a One Hit Wonder :("
neg,"Charlie Puth, the new young talent from New Jersey, was pretty much shoved down our throats by the radio during 2015. His debut album was completely overhyped, and the result is definitely a total disappointment. Nine Track Mind is merely a collection of Meghan Trainor and early 00s-inspired pop/R&B songs--passed as ""vintage""--mostly about obsessive love that sound like one very boring 45-minute-long track. 
Every song on Nine Track Mind can be considered bland radio filler. Nothing really stands out enough to make the listener go ""wow"", and the album gets boring and predictable after the first two tracks. Not a strong debut at all, but this young artist has all the time to come through with the next era and consider this just a ""seasonal buzz album"". Personally speaking, it was a rather boring experience I wouldn't want to repeat. "
neg,"Basic. A total waste of voice and talent, with an album full of mediocre feelings, trying too hard to be ""romantic"" but ends up being ridiculous. Full of balades that tried to be at least romantic, but end up giving tasteless feelings."
pos,"Parachutes, was just terrific. Then came along A Rush of Blood to the Head. That was a complete step up! X&Y was in some people's minds a bit of a downer, but I loved it nevertheless, being a huge fan of their music. Each of their albums have been enjoyable to say the least. All of their songs appeal to all sometimes with their lyrics, the structure, their piano, their guitar riffs, and Chris Martin's crooning little falsetto (which has definitely been left out of Viva La Vida). Viva La Vida is what I simply believe to be their best yet! Frankly, those who did not enjoy their previous albums will probably not like their new work nor their future music. Critics are just harsh.. and are meant to be. But they have millions of fans who have bought, listened, and enjoyed their work. That's all that matters."
pos,"This album is very good. Not quite their best(A Rush of Blood to the Head), but very good. The standout tracks for me include ""viva la vida"", ""chinese sleep chant"", ""strawberry swing"", and ""death and all of his friends""."
pos,"Have you people actually heard the album? Fantastic. I suprised Coldplay kept the streak. In organized fasion. Melodies are amazing. The weakest part of the album are the lyrics. It doesnt quite hit home. The theme is perfect. However, the lyrics arent bold enouogh. Some are actually kinda off. Big fish line in ""Lost!"". Yeah.. But Coldplay was never that great at lyrics. Ive heard this album at least 20 times now. It took me a LONG time to debate if this was better than ""Rush of Blood"". And I think it is for its themes, artwork, and the contribution the band has done to the album, Not to mention the music as well. They managed to change the style in a perfect way. An effort that is quite rare in the music industry. Their greatest album to date. 4. X & Y 3. Parachutes 2. A Rush of Blood to the Head 1. Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends (Very close to a masterpiece) Good Job Coldplay. "
pos,My favorite of all their work. I think this is the best representation of how much they have grown as a group.
pos,"Viva La Vida has renewed my faith in the band that I loved with Parachutes and AROBTTH, but lost in X&Y. I think most publications and websites are trying to be extra cautious about their rating for Viva La Vida because of overinflated grades given to X&Y. Given some time, I think this album will prove to be a keeper."
pos,"Once again, Coldplay reinvents their sound and moves into a new direction. It's clear that most people don't like change and are not quick to adapt to it. However, in a matter of time, people who expected the same sound from Coldplay that they produced on ""Parachutes"" and ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" will come to appreciate the new sound. After all, isn't it all about moving forward with something new? Viva La Vida delivers a new frontier for Coldplay just as Revolver did for The Beatles. It's a major step forward, and now the real fun can begin."
pos,"Orchestral arrangements are all over this record, as well as The Arcade Fire's ever-expanding influence. This isn't shocking. Chris Martin admitted at Austin City Limits 2005 (while supporting the lackluster X&Y) that fellow ACL act The Arcade Fire ""inspired"" him to venture outside his normal comfort zone. The result is a much more versatile yet cohesive sound than was found their last record."
neg,Mediocre album. We don't talk anymore is the only song that actually worth it. So sad for Charlie but I think everyone was expecting something truly good. This is pure shit
neg,"This album feels really soulless, unreal, bland and generic. This is just a bad attempt to be a mediocre romantic album. This is the worst album of 2016 by far."
neg,"Awful album. Basic songs, basic voices, basic lyrics. I really doubt someone can give this album praise. It's horrid. Just another One Hit Wonder. The only good song is We Don't Talk Anymore and that's why I'm giving this 1 "
neg,Nine Track Mind is one of the most uninspired albums I have ever heard in my entire life.I don't believe I've heard a record this bad in...well...uhm...I don't believe I've heard a record this bad.
neg,"Mediocre at best, awful lyrics, awful voice, awful production. He has no talent. One of the worst album debut ever. I can't believe some people like it."
neg,"A bad album, builded for a good singer, this is really sad about him, someone who write ""See You Again"" came with this BOMB, state of alarm, this album is really bad"
neg,"If I was him, I'd go back to the studio and make a new album, you might agree that we have no experience to critic but the critics are telling the same thing. And yes, I have listened to the album and it isn't 100% bad. I mean, ""We don't Talk Anymore"" feat. Selena Gomez could be a hit single in US with a radio impact, Tv performances and a gread music video. I think thats the high point he'll get in this Era. Sorry, Charlie Puth but thats not the righ way to release a lead album."
neg,"This album must be what anyone who hates pop music hears when they listen to pop music. It's boring, it's underwritten, it's underwhelmingly produced. These tracks could not get generic enough in their chord structures and their subject matter. It's mediocre, but it's the infuriating type of mediocre. Why did he think it would be a good idea to produce this album ON HIS OWN?"
neg,"BLECH! Someone must have left this on the counter for too long because it's absolutely stale! Amateur, repetitive, I think he was trying to sound like a bigger person than he is. ""Marvin Gaye"" is garbage and is insulting. Worst album in 2016."
neg,"So, we're not even six weeks into the new year, and we already have a strong contender for worst album of 2016. It's gonna be a tough task for anyone else to make a worse album than this pile of dross."
neg,"This was a total cliche . My ears hurt so bad . 

cheesy lyrics 
predictable sound 

ugly , really ugly. 

I think he needs to take a moment and re-think his career . He is going anywhere with an album like this."
neg,"I heard his solo version of See You Again. Apparently, he clearly needs to step up his game: songwriting, singing, appeal and quality. His lyrics are full of basic cliches and his music definitely doesn't have a quality that appeals to people. And his singing, he basically sounds like a homeless beggar trying to get people's attention through entertainment. With his case, it shouldn't be like that. If he can't make a better album than this one, he should just stick with being a producer instead of trying to make a career out of his non-qualifying sense of musical abilities. 

Also, I really thought I was gonna like ""One Call Away"", but NO! It was boring, it was full of clichÈs and he still sounds like a homeless beggar. Charlie, if you're reading this, you better take these as words of motivation so you can make a better album. An album that has REAL quality! No one wants you to stick with obsessive love, basic lyrics and lullaby ballads!!"
pos,"Easily the best Coldplay album I've ever heard. Lost is an amazing track, and this album is definitely worth the money. Go get it!"
pos,"Colplay changes it up a bit after making three successively blander albums, probably due to Brian Eno's involvment. Its a little different from their past stuff, but I would hardly call it experimental. Its their best album yet, though."
pos,"Excellent album, interestingly different from their usuall style."
pos,Great album that you need to listen minimum 3 times to hear how good it really is ! Looking forward tot the concert in Paris & Antwerp.
pos,"I'm 40, not a dad, and think Arcade Fire the most brilliant band this decade. And whilst this album doesn't match the greatness of AF, it has many moments of pure pop bliss. I feel sorry for those who can't find at least some enjoyment within, and for the morons who give it 0 - no doubt without even listening to it - just go put on your no name records and stop wasting our time."
pos,"Coldplay is the best!!! I love the entire album, it has an instrumental music and melodies amazing. Love it!!"
pos,"Most diverse album yet. Explores elements of Life and Death while shifting from light to dark every other song. The questions Martin raised throughout the album about afterlife is confirmed when the album dies (DEATH and All His Friends) and is resurrected with The Escapist which borrows the beginning of the first track (LIFE in Technicolor). Truly an art form in the conceptual sense and a masterpiece in the musical sense, even if it does deface itself (album art)."
pos,"After the disappointing X&Y this was a remarkable return to form for Coldplay. 'Viva la Vida', 'Lovers in Japan' and 'Strawberry Swing' are absolute classics. Because they are arguably now the biggest band in the world, people are quick to criticise anything they release. But make no mistake, this is a quality album, not one bad song on it."
pos,"Ok, so, first off, you need to know, that this is, by far, Coldplay's best effort by far, suffice to say that it is one of their best albums. if you didn't like their previous efforts, you won't like this one. But, its definitely worth a listen, for any rock fan. Give them a chance, its an album that will stick with you."
pos,"This is a very good album. There are few misfires, but many of the tracks are excellent."
pos,"I would die to hear Bono belting out Martin's very genius yet very U2-esque melodies. After a few listens, I would say that this is a spectacular album, although a grand departure from Parachutes and ROBTH (and we should never speak of X&Y again). But Coldplay is still at the top of their game, and nearly everyone else's game for that matter. Early standouts: the vaguely Japanese ""Strawberry Swing,"" the haunting ""Cemeteries of London,"" and ""Yes,"" where Chris Martin sings at a low octive among ARABIC VIOLINS--double the unprecedentedness! This album isn't a masterpiece, but it's a very satisfying addition to the Coldplay anthology. Viva Coldplay!"
pos,"I really like this album, more than X+Y, maybe even more than A rush of blood... Lovers in Japan and Lost were standout tracks, the title track is great. The first single, Violet Hill, is the least impressive song on the album but still not bad. Brian Eno's producing has a profound effect on this album. Change has definitely been good to Coldplay."
pos,Brilliant and a new direction for an already talented band.
pos,"Few artists have evolved like Coldplay, and this new album is a prime example of what the boys can do when they're not hounded by a record label. It doesn't seem like Coldplay's trying to please everyone on the new album - it seems like they made a ""We Don't Give a Damn!"" album, and it works. Aside from the low points found in ""Violet Hill"" and ""Chinese Sleep Chant"", the rest of the album is as solid as they come. The album gives off an aura of greatness, and it's about time it stopped being uncool to be a Coldplay fan. All hail Coldplay."
pos,"Bolder than anything else Coldplay has made but not completely different. This album does confirm that they actually know how to play instruments better than beginners. ""Yes!"" is a song to check out if you want to see their new musical direction. ""Lost"" is solid too."
pos,"Stand out tracks for me were Violet Hill, Yes, and 42. Cemeteries of London and Lovers in Japan sounded too U2-ish to me, especially the latter, but I guess that's what you get when you have Brian Eno producing. They still have yet to beat A Rush of Blood to the Head in my eyes, but this is still a good listen.
"
pos,"It's pretty amazing that Uncut, the same publication that gave the unbelievably shitty X&Y a 90, gave this album 60. One person below said they believed the critics were being careful with their ratings for this album because of all the rash 90's and 100's given to X&Y upon its release and I think that is exactly right. This is a much better offering and might even turn out to be their best album to date. "
neg,"I've heard the whole album, and I find it repetitive, the lyrics aren't good enough, so plastic, it is very boring, so I guess that my ears are bleeding, so sad."
neg,"After the 'Good Girl Gone Bad' era, I was expecting a huge record from Rihanna. Rated R was a letdown. The ballads are sappy and seemed to be pulled from Celine Dions reject pile. Not good at all."
neg,"Rated R' is a letdown from GGGB. There is too much filler and it sounds like she's trying to hard to convey the ""dark"" pop star role. However, she's at her best in the Caribbean inspired 'Rude Boy'"
neg,"Yawn....Wasn't expecting such degrading effort from RIhanna. After the gem she dropped in 2007, we get a sub-par effort. No bangers like umbrella to be found here! ordinary effort! poor!"
neg,"Very boring - you've heard it all before. Nothing catchy and undeniable. Strange, but the only good songs, ""Fire Bomb"" and ""The Last Song"", are both produced by Brian Kennedy and are both pop-sad. Probably because sadness is the same for sweet girl Rihanna and her Rated R version."
neg,Awful and overrated album.
neg,"She gets beaten one time and now she talks about Russian roulette. She's really gonna play off of this, not to mention many critics are talking about this. It's absolutely ridiculous. We get it she's been through rough times(like the rest of the world), she's not a girl...WE GET IT! Anyway, I can respect she's trying to change and go different directions but the music still isn't good, it just isn't. I've heard all this before, not original."
neg,"Few R&B artists are able to tackle an edgier sound with much success. Like most of them, Rihanna fails. Her emotional year is reflected in a set of disjointed songs that absent the physical abuse scandal would lack oomph. There's barely a likable track on the record and I don't expect any of these songs to top the charts."
neg,"Aside from a couple songs, this is pretty boring with songs like Stupid In Love, Rockstar 101, Wait Your Turn. Not her best. My favorite is Te Amo & Firebomb"
pos,"The album was good aside from the double tracks, which was a bad idea. I would probably say this was their third best album of the four."
pos,I can't stop listening to it its beautiful and moving I haven't been a coldplay fan since Parachutes.
pos,Best album yet. Brilliant song writing and performance.
pos,"This is proof that Coldplay are worth the hype and the fame. The album is adventurous, experimental, and emotional. It's nice to hear an album of songs that take you on a journey. I think they are one album away from making an actual classic."
pos,"This is, honestly, one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. The first track goes perfectly with the last track with the sort of synthy sound and coming back with that at the end of the album. It gave me goosebumps. Then, Viva la Vida is one of my favorite songs of all time. Violet Hill and Cemeteries of London also bring dimensions of Coldplay in which has not really been seen before in other albums, but is still fantastic. The Chinese Sleep Chant after Yes is a song that mesmorizes and is a wonderful addition. While this does sound U2'ish, that is not a bad thing. U2 is one of the most established bands of all time and to say that it sounds like U2 is a compliment more than anything else. "
pos,"I till don't get why everyone hates coldplay all of a sudden is it because it's unfashionable to like great music. I think that this record is one of the best of 2008 and anyone who disagrees is obviously not listening properly.
"
pos,"Amazing a rare album , youll never hear in years , instant classiic, anyone should get their hands on.. Its like an artwork wherein first you say okay.. then the more you visit it the more you start appreciating it until youve completely fallen in love with it. Coldplay have never been more consistent as a band ! All their albums are amazing keep it up!!! Although AROBTTH is still a contender also is X&Y.....THe new BEATLES they are."
pos,"A truly remarkable album that shows Coldplay as one of the best experimental rock bands out there.

This is probably their finest hour yet. Coldplay has crafted a wholesome album that sounds uniform yet entirely unique from their previous sound.

What each listener gets is not just a good collection but a musical journey that sonically varies from song to song creating a beautiful experience. There's no real tale because the concept is to take one on an adventure. Chris Martin probably has poured himself out the most on this album, spinning tales of war, love, and pain. On the title track, Martin describes himself as a king in his past life over a background that sounds like the theme music for the appearance of a celestial body. Violet Hill features shredding guitar riffs against the piano and Martin's megaphone-like verses.

But even some of those verses really stop Viva La Vida from becoming a classic. As much as the sound is sonic majesty, Chris Martin seems at a loss for words and at times weak against the superior background. His topical interests are as Paste Magazine says it, vague.

Take out all of that and you have one of the greatest 47-minute musical experiences of a lifetime. However, there is no doubt that Viva La Vida is far away from becoming the definitive Coldplay album."
pos,"Viva la Vida is a paradox, a collection of catchy yet graceful, deep yet entertaining, thoroughly enjoyable yet mentally stimulating songs that elevates Coldplay even higher into the titans of alternative rock. The title song is one of my all-time favorites; it along with the harder-sounding Violet Hill and the flowing, graceful all-instrumental Life in Technicolor make up the best of the album."
pos,"A great album, full of surprises. You can feel yourself in french revolution once more. It has a nice sense of continuation and a lot of experimentation"
neg,"""Very boring - you've heard it all before. Nothing catchy and undeniable. Strange, but the only good songs, ""Fire Bomb"" and ""The Last Song"", are both produced by Brian Kennedy and are both pop-sad. Probably because sadness is the same for sweet girl Rihanna and her Rated R version."" completely agree with you"
neg,"Not a good album at all. I only like 1 song, which is 'Rude Boy' I'm a Rih fan, but no there are no hits on this... I prefer LOUD though. Songs like Stupid In Love, Photographs and the other slow songs are a borefest."
neg,"Rated R' could of been good. It's just very boring and no excitement that I expected it would be... Her vocals have improved though, but more work is needed."
neg,"Boring album with sappy ballads. Rihanna is not able to evoke the emotions that is required for some of the songs, instead it comes off as sappy and bland."
pos,"Whenever music acts trying anything new, they often fail. Where X&Y failed in its ambitions, Viva La Vida triumphs gloriously!! This is Coldplay's greatest album!! X&Y reeked of U2 and had an unmemorable second half, but Viva La Vida is original and memorable all the way through. Chris Martin and his fellow band members have proved themselves talented once again, this time away from the extreme commercialism of X&Y!!! I really want Mylo Xyloto to be good!"
pos,"Viva la Vida could be the most ambitious and impressive Coldplay album. Tracks such as Viva la Vida, Violet Hill, Yes, Lovers in Japan, 42, and Life in Technicolor prove that Coldplay can be new and inventive while still staying true to their previous records."
pos,"Album number 4 from Coldplay came with the band at a sort of crossroads. Its predeccessor, X&Y was decent in parts but overall felt bloated and sounded like a band who had gotten lost in their own enormity. ""Viva La Vida....."" is a huge improvement and for me this was one of the albums of 2008. Looking back, it also ranks as a career highlight. Coldplay show signs of experimentation for the first time really here (Brian Eno's influence is obvious on it). The results elevate them to the level of the likes of their heroes U2. The songs are strong throughout, the production is top class without being suffocating as it was on X&Y and on some of the material the band have released since. The ideas that are explored are genuinely exciting. This record reignited my interest in Coldplay and proved, as U2 have time and time again, that just because your songs are really radio friendly doesn't mean your not a credible artist. Superb effort. "
pos,"Perfection: one of the best albums released in the past few years. Coldplay teamed up with Brian Eno and came out with something they have never showed us before. An album with a story-like feeling, left in the dark, slowly transitioning to the light. Brilliant."
pos,"Hearing most of these songs live makes it ten times larger than life. You never forget a Coldplay concert, that's for sure. Especially one advertising some of their best songs yet."
pos,"For the most part, It's a pretty solid album. There are a few songs I didn't care for but the songs I liked I thought were great. Plenty of instant Coldplay classics on this album - Viva La Vida, Violet Hill, so on so forth. It's well worth listening to if you are a Coldplay fan."
pos,"Also I've only got three single songs that are a 10 for me, the album is really fantastic. One of the best in my iTunes library and also Coldplay's best work yet. Their music is a work of art and so is this album. Chilling, diversified and also airplay capable. Very nice job!"
pos,"this is simply the best album of coldplay , i really really love the songs, it's lyrically thrilling and the music just amazing,. viva la vida is the song that made me love this band and discover their music, i can't get enough of this album, every single song is beautifull in every single way, long live the king (coldplay)"
pos,"I almost gave this album a 9 but decided to give it a 10 which is something I don't do very often. I don't really understand how this album didn't get mostly great reviews from critics as in universal acclaim. This album might be even better than A Rush of Blood To the Head but I won't say it is. My least favorite track from this one is Violet Hill but it's still a great song. The album is classic Coldplay from start to finish. The final track along with the hidden track is just simply beautiful! Other GREAT songs include Viva La Vida, Lost!, 42 and Lovers In Japan/Reign of Love. The other songs I didn't mention are wonderful too. Is this album better than Rush of Blood? I don't know but it should be Coldplay's defining album along with A Rush of Blood To the Head. "
pos,"Excellent album, well worth the positive critical reaction. The music is great, and I love that they're trying something new. For me, the low point of the album is ""Reign of Love"", and even that's pretty good. 
Favourite tracks: ""Cemeteries of London"", ""Lost!"", ""Violet Hill"", ""Strawberry Swing"", ""Lovers in Japan"". "

They say donít judge the music by its album cover, but looking at the horrible record art of Red Pill Blues (which also is a terrible record title) just canít help any instinct but be skeptic; give it a listen and reality does hit like a truck: Maroon 5 struggles all over on their sixth record. 

A very unpassionate Levine croons for over 50 minutes of uninteresting ideas and story lines with the bandís new take on production, injecting house, r&b, and funk. The production per track are identical, like listening for ten songs with different love problems but having same instrumentation, flow, and distastefulness."
neg,Red Pill Blues extends on Maroon 5's mediocrity. Instead of going for the usual rock and sometimes pop crossovers this album goes full electropop and Adam Levine is not flattering with that sound. What Lovers Do is a catchy song but it still is just not as good as their old work. This album is for sure a skip.
neg,"This atrocious album shows the bandís complete ineptitude to listen to themselves, which is a basic task for a musician, with ungodly melodic repetitions that could be played in torture chambers, insanely tedious and bland harmonic progressions, and a disgusting, systematized weak timbre that couldnít even be improved in a long apologetic jam at the end, all presented so innocently it makes me want to burn all physical copies in existence. "
neg,"I really wanted to give this album a chance, but it is just plain bad. Maroon 5 have been on a rapid decline over the past few years, and ""Songs About Jane"" is still their shining achievement."
neg,"Incredibly bland and forgettable pop from Maroon 5. I can't remember a single song from the album. It's just there. There was nothing good here. Not that I expected something good. 

I can't write a review for something that did nothing but give me a headache. I can't believe how far this band has come from Songs About Jane. That was actually a semi-enjoyable album. Harder To Breathe is still my jam. All the slight hyperbole and angry rambling aside, here's some kind of a review. 

On the album Maroon 5 descends futher into the chasms of soulless pop and R&B music. The album flows with the lowest amount of steam like a river about to go dry. Adam Levine sings in his usual high-pitched voice, though I guess this time it's not too bad. Actually thinking about it now the fact that his voice is a little subdued kind of makes the album worse. At least usually there's something about Levine's voice that gives Maroon 5 the slightest bite. The best parts on the album come from the various featured artists. No clue how they got Kendrick and SZA on this. 

Really could be the worst album I've heard this year. "
neg,Maroon 5 has now to succumbed to generic mainstream trash. Anyone who is expecting for the old sound will be deeply upset by the direction they have taken.
neg,"The worst album I've ever heard in the pop genre. It was awful.The sound of Adam is good on this album, but the lyrics and performance of other members of the band are catastrophic."
neg,"Changes for the worse. Degradation. It seems that this is the beginning of the end of the once beautiful band. Where did the drive, corporate identity? I do not understand why they need 7 people. For such a ""music"" enough three."
pos,"While I can say, as a Coldplay fan, this is NOT their best record (that would go to A Rush Of Blood To The Head), it's up there. This album, as produced by Brian Eno of U2 production fame, brings many experimental elements to the album, giving the band all new sounds to utilize like soaring string sections (almost the and combining that with their pre-existing sound. You get excellent songs like ""Violet Hill"", ""Yes"", and ""Lovers in Japan"". I praise Coldplay and Brian Eno for experimenting their sound. So at this point you're wondering why this hasn't got a 9 or 10. Well, honestly, I can say that my problem is that the album covers almost too much; I have to keep resetting my mind that ""Wait, 'Viva La Vida'? That's Coldplay right?"" Some songs are too far from their sound. Overall, It deserves a thorough listen, and if you're a fan of Radiohead (or experimental rock in general) this album would appeal to you more than their others. "
pos,"Coldplay, in each of their albums, find the way to stand out from the ordinary, thanks to two or three really great songs. It is the case in this one, with ""Violet Hill"", a really beautiful rock hit. But we can remember something else this time : much more than in their previous albums, Coldplay seem to have wanted to renew their style, making more complex and varied songs. In this album, the group surprises, in the right way. "
pos,"It was a mistake giving this album below 10. I regret it with all my life. Because this album lifts me up high and just makes me happy whenever I listen to it. Death and All His Friends is absolutely one of the best records I have ever heard. I love how Coldplay transforms cliched lines like 'Big fish in a little pond' into musical masterpiece. They simply breathe life to such lifeless and corny words. This album proves they are simply one of the best bands in modern generation. If not, the entire history of music."
pos,"This is an Amazing album. Coldplay performs some of their best work on this album, of course there are a couple of what I may call ""fillers"" but it was such a good album. I know that there was however some long time CP fans from back in the days of Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head that were not a fan of this feeling like some of the music sounding ""different"" however I totally disagree, besides what's wrong with a bit of change from time to time? I would defiantly recommend this album; my favorite songs were ""Life in Technicolor"", ""Lovers In Japan/Reign of Love"" and ""Viva La Vida"" (some very powerful lyrics right there!)."
pos,Coldplay has so much changed on this album. But changed for good. I liked theirs new music direction. This album like book including so many chapter. Every song of this album is like chapter of one book. This album for me not just only music album. Viva la Vida is Death and All His Friends is most artistic album i have ever listen
pos,"I still consider this one of Coldplay's best albums, at least in the top three, but maybe their best. I love that you can listen from start to finish and it leave it on repeat with seamless transition from last track to first track. They kept the classic Coldplay guitar riffs and didn't stray too far away from their origins with this album. I'd say this was the last album before their transition to more of a 'pop' type band where they started to experiment more...with some experimenting is not my favorite."
neg,the worst album ever. one of this year's overrated highlight anticipated albums that is not really worth to wait. contains a lots of filler and autotune. the degrading of her journey in pop music is getting real.
neg,Most of the songs on this album are boring. That's all I have to say. Without End Game it would have no credit.
neg,"The old Taylor always wore her heart on sleeve. However, the new Taylor sounds totally drunk, fake and super narcissistic. 
The lyrics went unprecedentedly awful. I can hardly believe they came from Taylor Swift, who used to be such a lyrics genius. Frankly speaking, ""State Of Grace"" or ""Clean"" is better than any song in Reputation. ""Gorgeous"" sounds like written by a 5 years old and sentences like ""My baby's fly like a jet stream/High above the whole scene"" and ""I'm so chill, but you make me jealous"" are very ludicrous. The album is full of boring and unimaginative sex scenes. I can feel how hard Swift tried to sound sexy and mature. Unfortunately, she sounds more like a teenager who never had sex and thinks posting sex scenes on her Snapchat makes her cool, or an annoying woman who chatters without stop about her sex life in a club after a couple of drinks. 
Swift tried to make Reputation a dark album but her darkness is superficial. The theme of this album is shallow and uninspiring. Actually, there are only 2 things she keeps talking about, how other celebrities and the medias bullyed her and how perfect her current relationship is. Without delicate portrait or appealing love stories, the ""angel boyfriend"" figure in Reputation is plain and fake. The reflection on love and life in RED, the confidence, independence and self-awareness 1989 conveyed, all vanished in Reputation. Swift used the whole album to complain about being a celebrity. She is playing the victim all the time and trying to feed her fandom a utopian love story. 
Maybe she is too absorbed in her role playing. Maybe she paid too much attention to playing up to her fans. Maybe she ran out of her talents. Selling more than 1 million in a week won't change the fact that Reputation is a terrible album. People are buying it because she is Taylor Swift. She was the old Taylor. Watching critics and swifties praising ""reputation"" is like watching the real life ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Everyone gets drunk by Taylor Swift's cheap spirits and tells each other it is nectar. Some of them are paid to drink, while others pay the drinks. And Taylor Swift individually instagramming each of the good reviews could be one of the biggest jokes in 2017. Who is she deceiving? The medias, the fans or herself? I'm afraid what will destroy her reputation is her weak music, instead of the medias, or any of her so-called enemies. 
Organized social media dramas won't make her a Bob Dylan or Beyonce. When it comes to music, people won't take the dramas more seriously than they take the Kardashians' butts. After reputation, I only have 2 questions. Where is the old Taylor and when will she come back?"
neg,"I tried to listen to her all new album's tracklist but finally I hafta say... This new album sucks. I dont like any songs at all. I bet she focused too much on her enemies like Kim, Katy, Kaney, Calvin Harris... and forgot about what the true music was. I used to be a loyal fan of her music, but now, Goodbye Taylor"
neg,"Ouch. Hugely frontloaded and overhyped album of 2017. At least 6 fillers. Sounds like songs rejected from 1989. Good lyrics tho but in general downgrade after 1989. Not much fun on this album. Darker in popish style but without character. It wonít be flop but #NotMyTaylorSwift. So do not count for songs like Shake it of or Blank Space. I like 5 songs on it - Look ..- Ready for it- So does it - Gateway Car - Donít Blame Me. She could basically release an EP not this full fillers compilation 

Probably the most frontloaded album this year. I can tell that tabloid reviewers are scared being sued by Taylor Swift or something because this album is far from 81 points at Metacritics... most of the songs sounds like a rejects from 1989. Only 4 songs are worthy attention and tbh nothing groundbreaking is on this album. All this hype is just too much. Recommending Look.. Ready for it .. So it does ... Donít blame me...and maybe Getaway car which is basically copy of OOTW or Style.... No hits. No Shake it off or Blank Space like songs... good lyrics in some of the songs but that wil be it... Shame"
neg,"A very bad production. It sounds so annoying. The same clichÈs lyrics and her vocal performance seems to be worse. 
It's Taylor's worst album 
Hope the old Taylor is not dead."
neg,"still wondering how TS became this overtly hyped pop star - bc let's be real, the woman doesn't have the vocals or stage presence to justify any of it. this collection of songs sounds uninspired and isn't going to be remembered in the long run. save your money, folks."
neg,"I was almost getting bored after listening to this album. Compared with 1989, Reputation is shit and dull af. Taylor keeps using the same materials and her songs are simply just about revenge. The catchy vibe of Taylor almost dies out as the songs sound just the same as others, making it so cheap and disappointing. Sorry but to anyone who says that ""this is obviously the best pop album of the year"", you guys are so biased. This is not even music anymore, this is more like a recyclable piece of trash. 
Sorry, but this is too disappointing. I really hoped for something better than Look What You Made Me Do but turns out it is even worse. "
neg,"Doesn't matter if it is selling more than 1 million in a week. the album is forgetable and cliche, it seems like any song of her last album ""1989"". Lyrics are hypocrates, keeps talking about what happened with Kanye West and it is so boring and with no inspiration."
neg,"This album is bad - much worse than I believe critics are making it out to be. 

Starting out, the subect material on this album is absolutely childish. Song titles such as ""Look What You Made Me Do"", ""I Did Something Bad"", ""Don't Blame Me"" and ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"" are all juvenile names of songs written by a middle school pre-teen girl but instead are the titles of songs off of Taylor Swift's 6th studio album. Swift goes for a supposedly more mature lyrical content in these songs, but in doing so only makes her seem more childish and shallow in her songwriting prowess. The lyrical content here is absolutely her weakest yet, with no defining features, and laughably simplistic looks at mature topics - just showing how out of her depth she really is. 

On that subject, this album also eschews the more bright, poppy sound off of 1989, replacing it with a ""rougher sound"". However, this sound is worryingly close to the gross bass, synth heavy dirge of the late 2000's, being uncomfortable to listen to, and offering no unique or redeeming qualities. Not only this, but Swift's instrumental choices match the lyrics in the sense that they remain woefully mismatched with her songwriting strengths. With this album, Swift tries to sound like Rihanna, but fails in every single way. While I appreciate her for taking a new creative step, this does not fit her character, style, songwriting, or production capacities whatsoever. 

While this album is at the least, competent, the uncreative lyrics and composition make it that most songs on here will be ones that you won't want to go back to. Hopefully, Taylor can learn from this for her next album, and develop more of the mature pop sound demonstrated on 1989 hits like ""Wildest Dreams"" and ""Style"", rather than the muddy, convoluted songs of ""Look What You Made Me Do"" or ""..Ready For It?"""

While it's not as great as XY or A Rush of Blood to The Head, it's still a pretty decent album though you'll be saying WTF at Martin's choice in Lyrics ( Paradise is the biggest offender). Ironically the songs are catchy as hell, You'll be tapping your toes and singing along to tracks like 'Charlie Brown', Major Minus, Every Teardrop is a waterfall' and Princess of China (One of the rare times I like Rihanna). The standout track for me was Hurts like Heaven which gets you pumped up for the rest of the album (This also is the opening song for the Mylo Xyloto Tour). If your fan of Coldplay, you'll Love this album, if you want to get into the band however, you're better of listening to their first three albums before hand. Other than that it's a pretty solid effort for Chris Martin and the Boys."

neg,"I am very disappointed by this album. As someone who has followed her since the very first single release, I have adjusted to her switch from country to country-pop all the way up to 1989. Reputation is where I draw the line. Her album as a whole is less singing and more talking/rapping, very auto tuned, and the messages of the song are all about sex, getting drunk to have fun, and they promote not taking responsibility for your own actions (instead blaming everyone else for your behavior). It makes it seem like having a bad reputation is actually a good thing. I just don't align with her message anymore as someone who has never drank or partied (there are lots of other ways to have fun). I love her singing voice! But alas you don't really hear it at all in these songs, but my rating is a one instead of a zero because there are parts in every song where I'm reminded of how wonderful her voice is, and some lines are very catchy. But there is not a single song that I love start to finish, and that is very sad for me. I never thought I'd see the day. "
neg,"This is her album so far, the music is terrible and the lyrics are the worst, she has managed to write such amazing songs but it seems with this era she forgot how to write."
neg,"Trash pop at its best. The most overrated artist ever. Don't buy good reviews please. ""And the Grammy's ALBUM OF THE YEAR goes to..... DAMN. by Kendrick Lamar"" please."
neg,"OVERARRATED. OVERHYPED. UNDERPRODUCED. 

Most of the people here giving it 10/10 are just doing so because its Taylor Swift. There is nothing special or unique about this album. It sounds like 1989 but with blander lyrics and unfinished trap beats. Don't Blame Me is best song but it has the exact same arrangement as Take Me To Church. End Game sounds like a Drake Song. New Years Day is a cute ballad. Other highlights of the album are Dress, CIWYW, So it Goes.Most songs are just bland, boring and generic that sound like rejects from 1989. LWYMMD and TIWWCHNT is trash and annoying. For Taylor fans only"
neg,"I don't understand how anyone could see the production or delivery on this album as an acceptable facsimile of rap and R&B. The songs more obliquely inspired by these genres feature an awkwardly delivered mishmash of talking, singing and rapping. The production in these songs are worse, oft sounding dated, clunky and uninspired. In an attempt to sound edgier she has effectively recycled and reappropriated out-dated trap and electroclash clichÈs. 

Similarly, her lyrics employ clichÈd metaphors and analogies about committing crimes and seeing herself and her new beau as the next Bonnie & Clyde. The thematic depth she explores is never past a surface interpretation of what a reputation is, or any criticism of anyone as always an open attempt to drag them through the mud. 

The songs on the album that fit a more melodic and synthpop direction feel more cohesive and work to the strengths of Taylor's voice and songwriting. However, in going in these directions she fails to set herself apart from her contemporaries and give a great sense of who she is as an artist. 

Overall the album is an out-of-touch, bland attempt at rebranding while using the same sounds her Top 40 peers have used before and venturing in 'edgier' genres like rap/trap/electroclash only to use their clichÈs as well. 

I really tried to like this album, I thought upon re-listening my opinion would change and she would be able to make the new sonic direction could work - unfortunately it's not well executed and sounds like her least fleshed-out and developed album to date."
neg,"At the risk of sounding like a crank, this artist is overrated. I hear shallow lyrics, formulaic music, and an average voice at best. But this apparently deemed great pop music of the time. Just not my time."
neg,"This album is (and I can't find any other word to describe it) lame, totally lame. You can literally put all the songs together and it would sound like one single track. Repetitive in rhythm and in lyrics, mostly empty and full of nothing more than attacks to media and her ""enemies"", this album doesn't go anywhere and shows a childish facet in Swift's music that tries its best to be as ""dark"" and ""new"" as possible, but can't accomplish anything. "
neg,"Hm, don't get me wrong. Sonic Youth is my favourite band, but this album just isn't that good. I find it pretty boring, and their worst album to date."
pos,"Nice mixture of alternative, synth-pop and a little bit of folk. Has a big, spacious, nearly anthemic sound, created by busy drumming, layered guitars and harmonized vocals. There's still some space for a few smaller and humbler songs. Lots of catchy and melodious tunes."
pos,i know that many people are disappointed but this is why coldplay is agreat band as the fans don't accept any other thing but perfection. though the album is great maybe the songwriting isn't so good but the music is very amazing and unique
pos,"Strong album. I was a bit disappointed though... It stands out from X&Y and A Rush Of Blood To The Head by it's genre, while being a continuity of Viva La Vida, a continuity with a whole different sound. They went more electronic using synth which gives the album both a modern and a 80's sound, which is... special... without taking away the Coldplay unique sound. A few songs stands out from Mylo Xyloto, I can barely spot songs that'll be hits, but as a whole, Mylo Xyloto is fluid, light, complex and impressive. It is worth your money, but do not expect this to be the album of the year."
neg,"Nothing happens on this album! I nearly fell asleep listening to this! Its not... awful, but it has really down beat and boring production, Chris sounds like he needs sleep, and the lyrics are...bad... ""Oh, man, you drugged me? That turns me on, come here!!"""
neg,"If I had only one word to use to describe Chris Brown's latest studio album, Royalty, it would be mistake.

The most compelling thing about Chris Brown the artist is that he has all the components to be excellentóas in the sort of megastar his most ardent supporters often say he should beóbut rarely is that reflected on his albums. Heís a decent singer with a nice tone, a proven songwriter, and an excellent performer, so in theory, he should be to the 2010s what Usher was to the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, Chris, like many of his contemporaries, lacks a cohesive vision, and that is, more often than not, reflected in his work.

There was some progress in a more singular sound on last yearís X, but he has since fallen back to old habits. Royalty is many things all at once though much of it is not particularly good. One minute Brown is a singer, the next a rapper, and not long after, the quintessential pop act. Itís fine to have many facets of yourself, but without vision, and in Brownís case, understanding the virtues of editing, the end result is a mess.
Whatís even more frustrating is that in trying to do so many different things, Brown steers away from what heís actually quite good at doing. Take ìWrist,î in which Brown basically goes back to rapper ín b with lines like, ""I'm a champagne-pouring nigga. I like big asses and tits."" Normally, the Houstonian in me would appreciate references to still tippiní on four-fours, but it comes across as rather banal and beneath Brownís talent.

The same goes for ìLiquor,î in which Brown lazily croons about wanting to drink and fuck. I mean, who doesnít like that, but again, how many times can one echo this sentiment in his career? On top of that, you hear songs like that only to be placed alongside his pop leanings like ìZero,î ìAnyway,î and ìFine by Me.î

On Royalty, youíre essentially taking a trip to the trap, and you make a pit stop at your mamaís house, who is clearly still a fan of pure R&B, only to later end up in West Hollywood; by the end of the trip, you just want to take your ass home and nurse your neck thatís been sent in so many directions sonically.

I can already hear someone arguing that the album is a relic and Brown is no different in releasing a string of singles as opposed to a cohesive effort. Sure, but donít you want more for someone capable oOn ìPicture Me Rolliní,î Brown sings, ìBaddest bitch, you know she mine, but you know I donít love them. I donít cuff them.î Brown couldnít be any more boring here if he tried. He does try, though.

Brown attempts to evolve from that on ìLittle More (Royalty),î which he dedicates to his daughter, Royalty, but there are some double entendres present that might make the listener uncomfortable. Brown is an R&B singer who has absolutely no idea how to talk about women outside of the context of sex and distrust of the opposite sex. Maybe his daughter will change him, but as of now, for all the love he has for his child, other women continue to have it tough on his works.

If itís anything, his reworking of Keith Sweatís ìWhoís Gonna (NOBODY)î and ìDiscoverî are solid. Chris Brown is quite good at bedroom music and baby-baby-baby please forgive give me tunes. Thereís not enough of either, however, and none of it would distract from the other problems all too prevalent here.

Considering Brownís output, it wonít be long before we get another album. Between now and then, I hope Brown finds a vision, people who can help him achieve it, and frankly, grows up a little bit. It would do wonders for him moving forward.f producing such? Actually, there is one constant found throughout the album: misogyny."
neg,"Woe to Chris Brown, the once-promising R&B upstart who now skulks listlessly around the fringes of the pop landscape, waiting for the redemption that seems less likely with each successive album. With Royalty, another marginal, uninspired effort whose release is wedged into the most remote, frosty corner of 2015, he seems less viable and more poorly managed than ever. The albumís title, with its nod to both a newborn daughter and his presumed status in the Top 40 firmament, thus ends up less of a double entendre than a sad gesture toward significance from an increasingly isolated artist. If anything, Brown remains a pretender to the throne, operating in an imitative thrall to more original artists, his assertions of his own brilliance sounding increasingly less and less convincing.

Brown continues to bear a hearty chip on his shoulder while offering little in the way of compelling material, attempting to ape the one-of-a-kind flamboyance and magisterial weirdness of R. Kelly. Beyond the general imprudence of a troubled, problem-prone young star trying to take up the mantle of one whoís gotten himself in even deeper hot water, the issue is that Brown bungles the entire enterprise. Take opener ìBack to Sleep,î an otherwise sultry slow jam that centers around an astoundingly ill-advised ìfuck you back to sleepî hook. Peak-career Kelly might have been capable of imbuing this gonzo tale of sneaky midnight intrusion with an air of kinky grandiloquence; in Brownís far less adept hands, the song strikes a regrettable mix of creepy and ridiculous.

At a time when issues of consent and sexual abuse are more visible than ever, kicking off an album on such sketchy ground is a staggeringly wrongheaded move. Royalty does little to counteract the bad taste left by its opener, offering up songs that, if inoffensive, tend to be blandly forgettable. Brown is still an inherently persuasive presence, good at jibing with guests (though there are only two here, neither much of note) and putting on a convincing lothario impression under the right circumstances. His voice is still strong and possesses the range to carry off a variety of styles, but these skills arenít enough to elevate material this weak, and the derivative nature of the songs leaves him feeling like little more than a mid-level opportunist, a potential top-tier star whoís now chasing trends rather than defining them.

Examples include the catchy ìPicture Me Rolliní,î whose blissed-out G-funk fetishism falls too closely in line with the 2015 mini-revival of vintage West Coast vibes. ìZeroî similarly has a pretty good neo-disco aesthetic, with warm synth washes and some genial Vocoder noodling, things that might sound novel were they not clearly ripped from Daft Punkís Random Access Memories.

This unoriginal approach is made even less palatable by the albumís unattractive mixture of gloomy self-pity and sexually charged swagger, the shaky balance between these two extremes serving as another reminder that Brownís problems are mostly structural; heíd likely be in a more favorable position right now with better handlers to shepherd his career. All this comes to a head in ìNo Filter,î on which the singer proudly declaims that his brash, painfully direct persona must just be too much for people to handle, as if he were dispensing deep truths instead of obnoxious public embarrassments."
neg,"In June 2015, once the Tyga collaboration Fan of a Fan: The Album had run its course, Chris Brown released the first single from his seventh proper album. Woozy ballad ""Liquor,"" with its hook of ""All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink, and fuck,"" was not atypical for him. The title and cover of its parent album, however, once publicized, seemed to signal a potential shift farther away from the carousing and belligerence that have dominated his work since Exclusive. Named after his daughter, and with an endearing portrait that features her on the front, Royalty nonetheless is designed more to please Brown's devout fans than illustrate growth. It begins with a song titled ""Back to Sleep,"" a lullaby of sorts, but it's definitely not for his daughter, and the majority of what follows is a qualitative step back from previous solo album X. Brown doubles down on his swashbuckling persona, boasting ""I'm a champagne-pourin' n*gga, I like big asses and tits"" and ""You know I don't love 'em, and you know I don't cuff 'em,"" and imploring ""Can I stick it in a little bit/Don't be shy, just a little bit."" Second single ""Zero,"" a disco-funk throwback replete with talkbox, is as spiteful as anything else in the Chris Brown catalog, where the singer scoffs, ""You think I'm thinkin' 'bout your ass?"" There's some irony in writing, recording, and releasing a song bragging about not thinking of an ex. With rare exception, Brown keeps it explicit, focused on flaunting. Some of the slow jams, like the Keith Sweat-referencing ""Who's Gonna (Nobody)"" and Jodeci-referencing ""Proof,"" are built on slinking productions that rate with the best of mid-2010s pop-R&B. Brown has been behind so much X-rated material that, when he keeps it clean, as he does throughout ""Make Love,"" the effect is jarring. Did someone doctor the recording without Brown's knowledge? Indeed, a more representative title for the album would have been that of the 13th track, ""No Filter."" That phrase reflects his personality and perhaps his quality control."
pos,"The critics of MX have all been saying the same thing; that is that Coldplay have produced an album of the same old music, and did not make an effort to change their sound in a radical way. Unfortunately, they are wrong. Coldplay have experimented with electronic and pop sounds for their new album, so much so that many fans have been claiming that the change is TOO radical! It is not possible to have both. Mylo Xyloto is Coldplay on a scale they have not reached before, and although a small drop after the innovative Viva La Vida's wild success was perhaps inevitable, this music reaches out to more people and they may become all the more successful for it. Standout songs include Hurts Like Heaven, Paradise, Charlie Brown, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, Us Against the World, Princess of China and Don't Let It Break Your Heart. A thoroughly entertaining and high quality listen."
pos,"Forget about critics. Most have hated Coldplay since the start. Yes, for the most the lyrics are crap. But who cares? This is pop music! Coldplay are influenced by many different music styles, i.e. rock, urban, and folk, and all are featured here in a tasteful way. From start to finish, the flow of the songs, and the segues are quite irresistible. The duet with Rihanna is the absolute highlight. It shows they are willing to stretch and try different things. Just like they did with ""Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall"". There are no weak moments here. It's an uplifting affair and it shows how versatile and 2011 the band is."
pos,"""Mylo Xyloto"", Coldplay's 5th LP, was supposedly influenced by New York graffiti - a theme visible from both the album artwork and the video for first single ""Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall"". Strangely enough, it is also very much audible in the music. Unlike the symphonic ""Viva La Vida"" and sonically overwhelming ""X&Y"", ""Mylo Xyloto"" revels in synth-based, warm, unabashedly pop melodies. The wonderful opener ""Hurts Like Heaven"" (discounting the title track intro) bursts with energy, lyrics flying past in a manner not heard in any Coldplay song before. It is an intoxicating indicator of things to come on perhaps Coldplay's most immediate album to date. If ""Viva La Vida"" was a bit of a grower, ""Mylo Xyloto"" instead wastes no time setting its stall. 

Unexpectedly perhaps, the star of this uptempo, smile-inducing, hell DANCEABLE album is the lavish guitar licks provided by unsung Coldplay hero Johnny Buckland. Whilst Martin is undoubtedly the face of Coldplay the rest of the band are, well, not just ""the rest of the band"". Faster and more complex than before Buckland is beginning to carve his own niche sound - a skill beyond measure for a musician - and the speed, dexterity and subtleness of his playing is more valuable than Martin's enthusiastic if slightly wobbly lyrics. 

Drummer Will Champion also demonstrates his own abilities to perfection, alongside his own beautiful vocals on album highlight (and ""Parachutes"" throwback) ""Us Against The World"". 
For any Coldplay fans afraid of the change the group are going through, they should be reassured slightly by the presence of such a song, alongside the quietly beautiful ""U.F.O"", ""God Put A Smile""-recalling ""Major Minus"" and ""Up In Flames"", a disarmingly simplistic but nonetheless gorgeous ballad. These fans are going to struggle to stomach the collaboration with Rihanna, a polarising debating point that I hope does not overshadow the brilliance on show on this album. ""Princess of China"" is the closest to RnB that Coldplay have ever got, with its bass heavy synths and stomping beat, and it does take some getting used to. 

If ""Princess Of China"" doesn't do it for you then other highlights ""Charlie Brown"", ""Paradise"" and ""Every Teardrop"", each song buoyant with hope, showcase a simple truth: like them or not, Coldplay are probably the best band in the world at what they do, and ""Mylo Xyloto"" is the band at the top of their game. A point has been deducted for some slightly dubious lyrics (""I turn the music up, I got my records on"") and the unnecessary separation of ""M.M.I.X"" from ""Every Teardrop"", but these are minor quibbles on an otherwise superb album. If anything else it should finally shut up their detractors who moan that ""everything sounds the same"" - whilst Brian Eno's work does bare some familiarities to ""Viva La Vida"" in places (""Life In Technicolour"" for example), the differences far outweigh the similarities. ""Mylo Xyloto"" is an uplifting, foot-tapping joy set to soundtrack many lives, mine included, for years to come."
pos,"This is clearly some of Coldplay's best work yet. There's a much more modern sound to Mylo Xyloto than any of the previous Coldplay albums, yet they maintain their unique sound that has been consistent since their earliest tracks. I would recommend this album to just about anyone."
pos,"It's a really solid album that hooks you on your first listen. Standout tracks such as 'Hurts Like heaven', 'Paradise', and 'Don't Let it Break Your Heart' are classic Coldplay songs, and while they are very poppy, they are also experimenting with new sounds - most of which are electronic. The production is top notch (thank you Brian Eno yet again), and overall it is another 'typical' Coldplay release; consistent, instantly enjoyable, not taking too many risks, and will likely be enjoyed by music snobs and the mainstream alike. The collaboration with Rhianna is unexpected but not a disaster as many people are saying. No doubt this albums singles are obvious and have big sounds all over them (paradise most noticeably), but underneath this sheen there are some really enjoyable songs on this disk. I really commend Coldplay for creating such high quality and consistently good music for such a long time. Highly recommended."
pos,It's not Coldplay's best but the critics are overlooking the beauty of the new sound that this album brings. I feel like a change in any band's traditional style is now frowned upon.
pos, I wonder why Metacritic only posts the bad reviews. I think Mylo Xyloto is a solid album and is up with Viva La Vida and A Rush Of Blood. The variety throughout MX is what makes it good. You got songs like Hurts Like Heaven and Up With The birds which I think they're some of the best work that Coldplay has done. Maybe what critics and fans don't like is the overproduction and use of electronica something very different from Coldplay. 
pos,"Amazing, beautiful, strange and very diverse. I consider this the Kid A of Coldplay, while I consider Rush of Blood to the Head to be the OK Computer. As you can guess, I like Kid A better, because this one is so risky. It's a beautiful piece of work and is near perfect. "
neg,"Compared with Rated R and even Loud, this seems a very PG affair, with affirmations of romantic love like ""Drunk on Love"" and ""Where Have You Been"".

The most extreme, lyrically and musically, is ""Cockiness (Love It)"", where the invitation to ""suck my cockiness"" is suspended within Bangladesh's bizarre arrangement, not so much a song structure as a crazy-paving collage of sonic fragments. It's barmy enough to stand out from the routine dubstep/electro beats cooked up by such as Stargate, Calvin Harris and Dr Luke, particularly in the relaxed, dipping groove of ""Do Your Thing"" and the skeletal, Oriental-sounding marimba progression of ""Watch n' Learn"". But elsewhere Rihanna struggles to assert her vocal character against a sea of effects: on Harris's ""We Found Love"", she sounds like a siren in a wind-tunnel, keening and superfluous."
neg,"It's sure to sell on brand recognition alone, but I doubt a series of mannered and soulless hooks are going to find much life outside of the European remix circuit.
"
neg,"There is no Doubt that she rushed this album, having her world tour and all, made the outcome of it her worst album out of the six. with little if any originality to it "
neg,"I expected so much more with this album . First single was amazing and then the disaster came in . Don't like the most of the songs , they are very cheap bronx - related crap "
neg,"Rihanna, like most pop artists, dabble into heavy electronic beats to make for lazy songwriting. Rihanna's past works wern't the musical opus of the 21st century, but at least they had decent hooks and a nice feel. Like the Black Eyed Peas, she's gone from a guilty pleasure to a throwaway pop act. This album should've just been called ""The I've Stopped Trying Chronicals, Vol. 1"". In a world where talents like Adele, Bon Iver Feist exist, why do we keep listening to Rihanna?"
neg,"If I have to review this album with 2 adjectives: cheap & overproduced. The production of ""Talk that talk"" has been clearly rushed since Rihanna had her world tour to accomplish. The lyrics are poor (90% per cent of the tracks talk about sex)
The quality standard definitely went down since her last album ""Loud"", and musically speaking Rihanna adds up nothing original. ""Where Have You Been"" could be a disco hit but clearly has nothing to do with the rest of the album, since it's a dancehall- electronic song, while the rest has an R&B/ Reggae print.
I admire Rihanna and her career, but this has been her worst album"
neg,"This is a horrible album. I hope she do some more real r&b. I love her, but I don't like ""Talk That Talk"" at all. She's trying too hard to be she wants to be. Maybe slow down and have a rest."
neg,"Boring Album! the lyrics and the melody are weak and confused. This is the album it more generic, with the sole aim to be successful in the charts. Rihanna needs to take a vacation. She no longer has musical identity."
pos,Great album with beautiful songs! Was hoping for more full songs and less intros but they still make listening to the album exciting! I love that Coldplay is trying out new sounds in their music and continuing to produce such great songs
pos,Another beautiful album by Coldplay. They manage to continue experimenting without straying too far from what made them great. This album really jumps right into the groove with Hurts Like Heaven and sucks you in. You are taken on a heavenly journey ending up on the beautiful last piano notes of Up With The Birds. Its extremely uplifting and will leave you a different person.
pos,"Mylo Xyloto is the fifth full-length album by Coldplay, following their 2008 release Viva la Vida. In many ways the two albums are similar, most notably they used the same producer, the legendary Brian Eno. They also both are noticeably different from anything they released before, both are much more upbeat and confident, and they take the use of many new instruments. The main differences come in the sound, Viva la Vida was darker and classical sounding while Mylo Xyloto has a much more poppy and electronic sound. But now lets really just get into Mylo Xyloto, the album that is under question. Martin has said that the album was influenced by old american graffiti. It is very apparent what he is talking about, all of the artwork has very bubbly letters and bright colors. This also translates into the music, as with all their albums the artwork matches the music almost perfectly. But when you look at the artwork for a while and listen to the music, you get the sense that the band has never actually seen or met the people and the culture that the graffiti came from, it seem like they have just seen pictures and could only see the silver lining in what is actually something that came from some very dark lives. At no point in listening to this music do you ever get the feel that you are on the streets, rather you feel you are in a studio with a wall being covered in spray paint by two lovebirds remembering their lives. It is very typical of Coldplay to romanticize things like this, and in all fairness it is probably what they were going for. When you get into the details of the music however, there are quite a few things that I am sure the band was not going for. Much of the music structure is repetitive, this is something they did a very good job to avoid on Viva la Vida. This also brings up my main problem with this album, and that is about five songs seem to want to be the climax of the story. There is nothing wrong with Coldplay making some stadium rockers, but it does not go well in the context of the album. There are so many screaming choruses by the time you get halfway through the album that you start to not take anything he says later on to heart. There are also no true highlights to this album either. 'Major Minus' is a pretty neat sounding rock song, but it cannot compare to something like 'Strawberry Swing' or 'Violet Hill'. The general feel this album gives me is not a big change from the last, it is just produced and recorded differently and lacks the high points. The only major difference is that it is much more of a pop record, but Viva could have very well been as well if that is what they wanted. All in all, this is not any major step away from 'Viva la vida', and in the grand scheme of things that really makes this album nothing spectacular. It is just a collection of some more songs for Coldplay to rule a festival with. "
pos,"Mylo Xyloto transcends all that I was expecting it to be. This album is an ode to music itself. It feels refreshing and gives a sense of transgression and revolution, the momentum is unbelievable. Coldplay surely place its efforts to elevate the sensations within their music and melody. Pure and beautifully crafted piece of art."
pos,"After listening to Viva La Vida, it's hard to see how Coldplay could possibly top themselves, but they just have! It is their biggest, brashest and most ambitious album yet. I've been needing to listen an optimistic album with meaningful lyrics for a long time, because all meaningful songs seem to be so negative. The standout tracks are 'Hurts Like Heaven', 'Charlie Brown', 'Major Minus' and 'Princess of China' with Rihanna. Many of the album's tracks have a lot of rock edge in them which should please the most rock-laden skeptics. This is a sensational album which I would recommend to anyone with all sorts of tastes!"
pos,Very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good! It is very and very good!
pos,"Coldplay keeps on art-fying their music; Mylo Xyloto is a fine collection of tight tunes keeping true to the theme. They all relate to each other. It's hard to think of the album without any of its songs. The band could easily keep on the road set by Viva la Vida, and still they try and venture on new sounds: and sucessfully, nonetheless."
pos,"Seeing as Coldplay is the one band I consistently listen to I was really looking forward to this album. Taken as a whole it's good--sometimes really good. The melodies are catchy, occasionally brilliant (Paradise, Major Minus, Princess of China, Hurts like Heaven) and the overarching theme works well; however, I had sort of hoped that there would be more experimentation. Still I love/like nearly every track with the exception of Every teardrop is a waterfall (I'm sorry it's just weak, albeit catchy) and Up in Flames.
To sum up, if you're a fan of solid, feel-good music this album's for you."
pos,This movie is a trippy good time kinda futuristic and very deep at times. It feels like Coldplay whereas Viva La Vida was so neat because it was experimental. But If you are a fan of Coldplay and want a mixture of there first great pop sound and Brian Eno's collaborative unique twists you should love this album! I feel this album growing on me each time I listen and I feel that some of the critics are being too harsh! This might be there most brilliant work YET!
pos,"Don't know what everyones problem is with this album. Amazing production values, the bands songwriting is better then ever with Chris Martins lyrics showing improvement. Its an amazing album, with frickin great rock song plus the more ballad songs that have allways been present on all of coldplays albums but just take a few days to like those love ballads. I understand why critics give it bad reviews, they are paid to criticize everything. Mylo Xyloto gives us a Coldplay sound we haven't heard before, which is what most of us wanted, now you get it and you cry like a little **** Honestly if your a true coldplay fan, you will love this album, it still is Coldplay, the album is still full of amazing songs that I cannot stop listening, although the sounds doesn't sound like there previous albums, it still sounds like coldplay. **** me, this whole world is starting to become full of princess' who won't ever be happy with everything. Coldplay have spent all this money to bring us another great album and all you negetive bitches sit there and say Chris Martins songwriting is worst then before, well its better then before and the lot of you who say you could have written better songs then this with Coldplays Budget, well I would have like to see you do just that. You would fail miserably. Coldplay are the biggest band in the world right now, and have had Universal acclaim for Chris Martins songwriting you ****ing gooses, bet none of you play 1 instrument compared to the dozen instruments Chris Martin plays now, hahahahahaha.
"
neg,"""Talk That Talk"" seems like it is an EP rather than an album. It's too short and it sounds very unfinished. It's a very safe record by Rihanna with the same tired Euro dance formula and her emotionless, bland ballads.... One of the most sentimental tracks ""Farewell,"" wants to be good, but she fail to produce the emotion to make it great. Overall a very terrible album."
neg,What an underwhelming pop record. Probably the worst of the year. The vocals sound tired. The production sounds rushed. The ballads lack emotion and are dull. There's no artistic growth whatsoever.
neg,This cd is such a disappointment! Talk the Talk may be the only good song on the whole cd. She definitely needs to take a little mini break after this and get back on track!! She lost the r&b and is letting the euro music take over her whole cd.
neg,"Rihanna is that kind of artist that goes with whatever's hot at the moment. There's no music artistry, no connection to the (awful) lyrics. Don't waste your time with this."
neg,"this girl giving me this mess after the anthems from LOUD gave me lifeeee no no no riri this 0 is well deserved
give me rudeboy 2.0 not rudeboy 0.5 and i dont want songs about damn pastries although i will say **** is my reason to LIVE tonight the rest are negatives"
neg,One of my most anticipated pop albums of this year... Unfortunately I was left disappointed. There's no artistic growth. The songs sound unfinished and rushed. There's no song that blow you away... Really disappointed with this!
neg,"So called ""princess of pop"" would be wise to stick to one genre, instead of multi-dipping in electronic rave from Harris, less-then-unoriginal teary ballads and reggae rhythms. I wish I could support her bipolar attempt to rule all kinds of dancefloors, but I simply don't seem to be able to follow her.
Talk That Talk is an overproduced, shallow album with absolutely nothing ambitious and enjoyable."
neg,"Unfortunately this album left a lot to be desired. I found the album to be trite, uninspiring and lackluster. Rihanna is definitely in need of a long extended break from the music scene."
neg,"EPIC DISASTERPIECE!!!, The Only good songs are You da one, talk that & Red lipstick. Thats it :/ 2/5. Her WORSE album to date! & I thought loud was Generic"
neg,"There's a difference between sexy and down right nasty/disgusting! Even if you buy this album get the edited version...my gosh she talks about her self with no respect what so ever! She can't sing, cant dance, the only thing she does properly is being a slut. There I said it...besides....we're ALL thinking it!"
neg,"A Zero may sound severe but im being honest telling you, this album is really that bad. Its superficial (in a bad way), cheesy, boring, unoriginal and unispired. Dont waste your time listening to this like i did, dont waste your money buying this sad generic album, there are hundreds of real artists who really deserve the attention and support."
neg,"Fumbling through the numbers, Talk That Talk is an identity crisis. Attempting to marry the dance-pop, urban, and ballad-leaning sides of Rihanna, it is a melting pot of goop. With production above par, the lyrics are at their worst. However, Rihanna makes the best of even goop, and delivers on each track in a way that each track feels as more than an album filler. But on an album where pacing is non-existent, it caters to the cherry-picking iTunes masses. Talk That Talk simply does not work as an album."
neg,"One of the worst albums of the year thus far. It shows absolutely no artistic growth, the lyrics are elementary, and the vocals are non-existent. All in all, a terrible album."
pos,"As it may be a disappointment to some Coldplay fans, I respect the fact that they are actually willing to experiment with their sound, which means to take risks, adding a more electro-sound to their music. Was it a smart thing to do? Of course, it's always smart to experiment, but it's the outcome that matters. In Coldplay's case, they actually managed to pull it off. Mylo Xyloto sounds like an album to where you can still identify that it's Coldplay."
pos,"Yes, this album is a disappointment of sorts, but it's better than the reviews suggest. Coldplay have always been and will always be deeply unfashionable, and it would be fair to say that in between Viva la Vida and this album they have realised the value of not trying to be fashionable. Rather than dressing up as Arcade Fire, they've made a reasonable effort at crafting a more unique identity, which is apparent in the music. Most importantly, they've played to their artistic limitations rather than settling for pretension. The songs aren't much to rave about, but the tunes are solid. Hurts Like Heaven and Charlie Brown are up there with their best work yet, especially the former, which has the kind of fast-paced confidence and, dare I say it, balls that a lot of their earlier work lacked. They are at their worst when they pander to the lowest common denominator on Paradise and Princess of China, both of which are very weak, bloodless and irritating. The rest of the album follows a fairly consistent Coldplay formula, which is nice to listen to, but not at all challenging. They have played it safe on this one. Leaving the quality of the music aside, I'm bemused by the various reactions that this album has garnered. It is impossible to intellectualize Coldplay's music, because it doesn't serve any intellectual purpose, so why do people bother trying to analyse their own reactions to it? They can't be taken too seriously; they're just a fairly lighthearted band who make fairly lighthearted music that doesn't have to mean anything to be enjoyed."
pos,"Excellent album, one can really appreciate the blood, sweat and tears which has gone into to the production of this album. Coldplay take pride in their work, they want to be the best. They have delivered a great great album!"
pos,"Its a good album not their best ... but very worth your buy... with all the crap in music nowadays .. its great to escape with Coldplay Always.. and this is kinda poppy album but in a good way.. it may lack some tracks or atleast 1 more track.

Lots of epic songs in the album you dont want to miss out on. which is why its worth the buy."
pos,"Mylo Xyloto is a very good album. Most of coldplay's other stuff is better but i actually like this album more than X and Y. It has some really good songs but none of them really stood out as favorites. If you are a coldplay fan you should buy it, it is a good album, just not their best."
pos,"I'm just going to be honest. I've been a faithful U2 fan nearly my entire life, and I've regarded Coldplay as yet another wanna-be Bono-band. But the second I heard ""Hurts Like Heaven,"" that opinion changed. I thoroughly enjoyed this album, even as someone who dislikes the band overall. That must mean that this is a damn good album."
neg,"When you're at Rihanna's level you can afford the best songwriters and producers in the business and sonically the album is generally far ahead of her peers. Yet if Sia's Diamonds is a sultry triumph, its character and uniqueness highlights the ultimately hollow pleasures of much around it."
neg,"like all the rihanna albums, HORRIBLE AND CAN NOT BE HEARD IN THE EARS. How can a singer with so many resources and still produce merde, maybe it's just she doesn't have the talent at all, what she's got is just SHIT"
neg,"I just have mixed feelings about this album, I was excited when I purchased this album but with the majority of songs on ""Unapologetic"" that I listened to, I was disappointed. It didn't appeal to me like the previous albums that she has made e.g ""Loud"" or ""Talk That Talk"". ""Unapologetic"" is certainly not the best album that has been made by R&B star Rihanna. I give her credit that her lead single off her album ""Diamonds"" was good, but that's the only positive feedback I can give this album"
neg,"Very bad album. I like only 4 of the songs - Phresh Off The Runway, Jump, Stay and Right Now. The other tracks are bland and boring. This album is the worst from Rihanna. She is trying to hard to be ghetto while she isn't. She is a POP star and she must embrace it"
neg,"LMAO at people giving this album a 10, its a 3 at best with only a few decent songs and production. And it has nothing to do with her situation with Chris Brown or any other excuse. Her music just gets worse and worse but it doesnt matter because her stans will never admit it."
neg,too much auto tune going one as she has changed both her appearances and voices many times to keep up with the other artists trying to be something that they are not.
neg,"One of my most anticipated releases this year and I'm left disappointed. ""Unapologetic"" could of been a great album, but it lacks those BIG dance anthems that Rihanna is known for. Overall very vapid and no artistry whatsoever!"
neg,"Well, another year has passed and Rihanna has done another album. Big shit surprise there. 

After last year's half-assed cheap cash-in piece of shit that is Talk That Talk, you'd think that Rihanna, her songwriters and producers would have learned their lessons from that album and her record label should've let her have a break from the music world for a while. But NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! They have to make another ridiculously rushed product just to cash in on a already ridiculously rushed product. 

This album is just terrible. The lyrics were boring and repetitive, the music is uninspired and I felt like they wasted Eminem's talent on the track Numb. If you're expecting another Love the Way You Lie from them well don't. Eminem's rapping only lasted 30 seconds. WHAT IS THE **** POINT ON PUTTING HIM ON THE SONG ANYWAY??? 

Alot of the tracks on this album are just fillers and uninteresting to listen to and I fell asleep half the time. 

But the album starts to get good during the second half of the album with tracks like Stay being a nice piano track, Half of Me is a pretty good track pretty much thanks to one of the writers being Emeli SandÈ and Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary being by far the best track on the album. 

But the track Nobody's Business was just disturbing to listen to much due to the fact that it has Chris Brown on the track because well, he beat Rihanna up like a bodybag three years ago. While it has a nice sound and a OK sample usage from Michael Jackson's track The Way You Make Me Feel, you just cannot help but just thinking about the incident at the back of your mind. 

Rihanna's vocals on the album is once again a hit and miss. Some tracks she can give out really powerful vocal chords and yet on some of the tracks like Phresh Out the Runway, Pour It Up, Right Now and No Love Allowed I just felt like she was just using one different vocal chord on each of those tracks and it has got really stale. 

While it still have some gems, the album as a whole though is just a bore. For most of the album's length, Rihanna's singing is dull, the music is dull and it feels more like a half-assed EP than it is a full length album. 

With rushed under-produced tracks, rushed production values, being boring as hell and relentlessly forgettable, Unapologetic is a big mess. 
"
neg,"What did Rihanna do? The album cover is terrible. The songs on the album are terrible. The lyrics of every song are terrible.. The only listenable song is ""Diamonds"""
neg,"I like Rihanna, but her formula is getting stale. It's almost like she's not needed on the project; she's not the engine behind the album. The main figures on this album seems to be the producers and the host of writers employed. She serves up some urban cuts and sappy ballads. She also collaborates with her beloved, convicted domestic abuser Chris Brown on the insulting ""Nobodies Business."" Overall, 1 or 2 ok tracks and the rest same old, same old"
neg,"WOW, can't believe that Rihanna will collaborate with a man who abused her and be so nonchalant about it. Her actions are irresponsible and sends the wrong message to her young fans. She should be setting a better example. Other than that, the music doesn't live up to the hype. It doesn't contain any of those anthemic hits that brought her stardom and we've grown to love. Overall very rushed and not many good songs. Disappointed in Rihanna and her music."
neg,"Dull, numb and stupid. Rihanna releases a new single accompanied with other 13 songs that don't stand out. Best tracks: Diamonds. Listenable tracks: Pour it Up. Hated tracks: are there any more tracks on this album?"
neg,"I dont know what Rihanna is thinking trying to release a full length album every year. Her quality has gone WAY down even since the release of ""Loud"" her last good record. There are only two good songs on this album, ""Stay"" and ""Diamonds"". I feel she needs to talk a good 2-3 years and work on the QUALITY of her music again and not just worry about the quantity that she releases.
"
neg,"The production of this album is just gives a lot to talk about. This Album Is Poor in the lyrics, on the sound, only the vocals is something good on this album. Even the artwork and the essence that this album gives is the same as Talk That Talk and Rated R, She should wait to release her albums a little bit longer."
neg,"Rihanna Has Proven In The Past To Make Good Albums (Loud, And Talk That Talk) 
But Sadly This Album Is By Far A Major Low Point In Her Music Carrer.. If Every Song Was Like Diamonds And Mother Marry I Would Give It A 10! I Only Liked Two Songs, I'm Being Very Harsh Because She Can Do So Much Better!"
neg,"What did Rihanna do? 

Let's just start from the basics. The album cover is terrible. The songs on the album are terrible. The lyrics of every song are terrible. She needs new writers, or to just start writing her songs. 

The only listenable songs are ""Diamonds"", ""Lost in Paradise"", and ""Nobody's Business"". Don't bother buying the rest."
neg,"I miss when Rihanna knew how to make great songs and great albuns like "" Loud "" , "" Rated R "" ,Unapologetic is so disapointing . The songs don't have any feeling is just electronical sounds , she should stop for a while and make good albuns like she used to."
neg,in my opinion this is the worst album she has ever released..the only song that i like is stay...! i was expecting sth different..she should release another album this year that will be like her previews ones so we will forget about this so bad album.
neg,"I Love Rihanna! LOUD And Talk That Talk Were Perfect Albums! This Album Is By Far Rihanna's Worst! There Are So Many Things Wrong With This Album But Dubstep Is The Main Issue! Vocally Rihanna Is Still Here Though... Diamond, Stay And Mother Marry Are Great Song... The Rest Belong In A Strip Club's Trash Can.. As A MEGA Fan I'm Really Sad That This Album Sucked!"
neg,"Merry Christmas...and fuck Justin Bieber, he just ruined my Christmas 2 years ago, I believe."
neg,"A kid who every girl knows, and every guy hates (mostly). He makes you try to like him, but I never will. He is a singer who's vocal cords are warped with auto-tune and ruined my holiday spirit. He does not deserve any attention, I will give him something though, he is very generous with his money and I do respect him for that. But I'd rather him be just that, an activist not a male idol in many girls eyes. His music is all about love, love and more love. He's obviously an attention freak, and I mean every word of it. He is a bad role model for children, where all these photos surface of his smoking pot, getting arrested etc. He is a person who never should of began singing, he has ruined what music should be. He is all auto tune and everyone should know that. Stop the Bieber fever, get your children vaccinated now and destroy any and all Justin Bieber books, CD's, etc"
pos,"Yes, this album is a disappointment of sorts, but it's better than the reviews suggest. Coldplay have always been and will always be deeply unfashionable, and it would be fair to say that in between Viva la Vida and this album they have realised the value of not trying to be fashionable. Rather than dressing up as Arcade Fire, they've made a reasonable effort at crafting a more unique identity, which is apparent in the music. Most importantly, they've played to their artistic limitations rather than settling for pretension. The songs aren't much to rave about, but the tunes are solid. Hurts Like Heaven and Charlie Brown are up there with their best work yet, especially the former, which has the kind of fast-paced confidence and, dare I say it, balls that a lot of their earlier work lacked. They are at their worst when they pander to the lowest common denominator on Paradise and Princess of China, both of which are very weak, bloodless and irritating. The rest of the album follows a fairly consistent Coldplay formula, which is nice to listen to, but not at all challenging. They have played it safe on this one. Leaving the quality of the music aside, I'm bemused by the various reactions that this album has garnered. It is impossible to intellectualize Coldplay's music, because it doesn't serve any intellectual purpose, so why do people bother trying to analyse their own reactions to it? They can't be taken too seriously; they're just a fairly lighthearted band who make fairly lighthearted music that doesn't have to mean anything to be enjoyed."
pos,"Excellent album, one can really appreciate the blood, sweat and tears which has gone into to the production of this album. Coldplay take pride in their work, they want to be the best. They have delivered a great great album!"
pos,"Its a good album not their best ... but very worth your buy... with all the crap in music nowadays .. its great to escape with Coldplay Always.. and this is kinda poppy album but in a good way.. it may lack some tracks or atleast 1 more track.

Lots of epic songs in the album you dont want to miss out on. which is why its worth the buy."
pos,"Mylo Xyloto is a very good album. Most of coldplay's other stuff is better but i actually like this album more than X and Y. It has some really good songs but none of them really stood out as favorites. If you are a coldplay fan you should buy it, it is a good album, just not their best."
pos,"I'm just going to be honest. I've been a faithful U2 fan nearly my entire life, and I've regarded Coldplay as yet another wanna-be Bono-band. But the second I heard ""Hurts Like Heaven,"" that opinion changed. I thoroughly enjoyed this album, even as someone who dislikes the band overall. That must mean that this is a damn good album."
pos,"Most albums have one or two songs you love more than the rest, a favorite that elevates an album full of filler. Mylo Xyloto does not have that favorite... but I can honestly say there is not a single bad song on this album. Every song is amazing in its own right, from the ridiculously catchy Hurts Like Heaven, to the hook-laced Charlie Brown, to the acoustic masterpiece of UFO and the simplistic majesty of Up in Flames. And then there's the rest of the album, laced with great songs like Paradise, Major Minus, Princess of China, and Don't Let it Break Your Heart. There's only one real problem with Coldplay's fifth studio album; it lacks that final piece that could make it a masterpiece. Maybe it's the lack of a coherent concept that holds it back. Maybe its that, occasionally, the lyrics just come a little too short. In the end there are fantastic albums, and then there are masterpieces. Mylo Xyloto is a fantastic album. But it's not a masterpiece."
pos,"the thing I find so funny here is how I don't think anyone would actually like to get under that mistletoe with him. It addition to this, all these love songs are probably just written to the ghost of Christmas past."
pos,Beiber cares about the silly money and lesbian girls. No respect for our generation and he needs to respect constructive criticism on his style of music and respect the media! in this album it's gets dumb
pos,Another awful album from Bieber............definitely one of the worst Christmas albums to date
pos,"The worst CD EVER!!! This album have much mistakes, first the title is horrible, the voice of Bieber is horrible, the songs, any good song, all are awful, I believe that his last album be bad, but this is terrible."
neg,"This album is nothing more the My World 3.0 The Christmas Edition with some of the worst vocal work I've ever heard. The only thing that saves this album at times are the featured artist like Boyz II Men. The one good song would have to be Fa La La, and it's only good if you take out Bieber's god awful vocals, and his white boy rapping on Drummer Boy is just unforgivable"
neg,"Great way to kill holiday songs I used to love. Not only does this butch prepubescent mess manage to overproduce every track, but the vocals are so wrong in every way."
neg,"this is another really really annoying song of a little girl who just wants money and don't care about his fans, corny, i cant believe there's still people who likes him"
neg,"Worst Christmas album ever with Mariah Carey's ""Merry Christmas II you"". I hate JB so much, why can't he just stop making music. The critics also overrate his crap. Shoot JB with a water gun that has pee in it and avoid this album at ALL COSTS!! What a pile of dog poop. IT EVEN HAS MC GUEST STAR!!!"
neg,Justin is the worst product of the decayed music industry. How long we have to listen this horribles and stupid pseudo musician teen idols? Merry Christmas.
neg,"Now that is what I wanna see, underrated Justin Bieber bullcrap. The songs are just a sack of bo*lo*ks with pee. Very horrendous,horrible,terrible,crappy album THAT YOU SHOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! Please do not get this because it sucks. Buy Mario Party 10 instead."
neg,"What the hell is this album, every song is lame. And his vocals sound like they are getting worse. The songs are slow or just plain boring, its going to be obvious that this album will sell good cause all his fans will cry to there parents to get the album, but for someone who is the biggest thing in music, his albums are shit lol. The industry is becoming a joke to let some looser release another album when his last 2 albums were crap that had generic song.

To be honest mistletoe is the only good song, the rest are just weird to listen to, especially with bieber singing them. Its a christmas album that has songs on it that combine that christmas sound the the electronic sound and it doesn't work at all. And his rapping made my hole family drop in laughter. and my little sister loves Justin, but even she couldn't stand this album at all. Except Mistletoe."
neg,"just a fail christmas album with track after track a voice deep that it sounds like his voice is craking for 37:51 straight 
waste of money and total nightmare"
neg,"Innovation and art. Only listening the first song of this album you realize it's a masterpiece, an album destined to change music history defining the sound that will dominate in the next years and that a lot of artists will take as an influence... Yes, I was talking about Physical Graffiti of Led Zeppelin. The complete opposite of the album that I'm doing this review, Under The Mistletoe of Justin Bieber. Let's begin: This CD is the mix of seedy Christmas songs and Bieber's My World 2.0. The result, obviously, a complete fail. I have listened the entire album, and I can assure you that it deserves the lowest rating that can exist. When you listen to the first song, you begin to think: What the hell is this? No musical taste, all the time the same thing, no catchy, only saved because there is a ""guitar"". But it will disappear in the next songs. After listening to the main single and song number 2 (Mistletoe), it's clear that all the album is going to be the same, song after song. It is. Boring and boring, with no taste of rhythm, with some ""interesting"" openings (like Home This Christmas, song n 10), but when he starts to sing all falls down. And the worst are the Dance-Pop parts, with the ""electronic"" awful drums bases that doesn't fit at all with this corny Christmas spirit omnipresent on the whole album. The best song is Silent Night, because is the less modified traditional song, without electronic appalling bases. And the worst song on the record, and surely the worst ever made, is Drummer Boy, where Justin does a WTF rap that would make Ice T, Tupac and Run DMC cry and despair, with the most absurd lyrics ever written "
neg,Ladies and Gentlemen time for your ears to bleed and your Christmas to be ruined and utterly atrocious album and something that you will not want to listen to.
pos,"Mylo Xyloto continues Coldplay's excellence at evolving musically even if one or two tracks don't quite hit the spot. Paradise, Up in Flames, Charlie Brown,Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, and Hurts Like Heaven are triumphs that elevate the immense quality of this album."
pos,"Mylo Xyloto is a very good album. It combines the classic Coldplay touch with electronic, pop and rock sounds. The lyrics of the songs are mostly fine, with the exception of the last few songs of the album. The singles so far are mixed for me. ""Every Tear"" is disappointing, but it is saved by the uplifting tone of the song. ""Princess"" isn't very good, but Rihanna does give it a certain energy which makes it better. But ""Paradise"" is by far my favorite. The orchestrated music at the beginning, the atmosphere of the song and Chris Martin's voice all contribute to the song's epic feel. If you're a hardcore Coldplay fan, this might not be the style you're used to, but I'd recommend you to pick it up. If you've met Coldplay with Viva La Vida or X&Y, you will definitely love it, as it has a lot of similarities. If you've never even heard of Coldplay, listen to the singles and judging by those, decide to buy it or not."
pos,A very solid album. Not quite as good as Viva La Vida overall. It has a lot more pop and is a lot more straightforward and as a result is not as exciting. Having said that it still has plenty of great tracks and it all comes together pretty well. The musical interludes work really well. UFO and Us against the World are weak and Princess of China goes so well until Rhianna or whatever her name is gets involved. The thing about Coldplays best albums were that there were no real weak tracks. Everything else here is as good as anything they've done up to now.
pos,"Masterpiece. I could listen to this album on loop for hours. All the songs are good, but the best tracks I think are best are ""Charlie Brown,"" ""Hurts Like Heaven,"" and ""Us Against the World."" Mylo Xyloto offers music for old and new Coldplay fans, with tracks that showcase the band's past and present. Because of this unique quality, It is my favorite album Coldplay album to date!"
pos,"From start to finish, ""Mylo Xyloto"" is a acoustic/synth work of art. Chris Martin's infectious melodies fuels the band's musicianship. Standout tracks include ""Hurts Like Heaven,"" ""Charlie Brown,"" ""Up in Flames,"" and one of the best singles of 2011, ""Paradise."""
neg,"Flat voice , annoying sound, we can consider that the only thing helpful in this album is some compositions , boring teen pop , childish, and immature , expected more from you Bieber , nothing new about the sun , always the bubblegum pop to fasten the little girls teenagers, we still have a Purpose , and a Believe to save the right discography"
neg,"This album is very generic and worthless. Missing connection between tracks. The lyrics and their melodies are nothing new, it seems to be a recycling of sounds already gavados by other artists"
neg,"A lump of coal is a much more pleasant gift than Justin Bieber's sorry excuse for ""music."" No really, it really is. At least with a lump of coal, I won't have to deal with teenie-bopper crap."
neg,"There really seems to be no end to Justin Bieberís insistence at shoving himself down our throats. In the two years since the appearance of his debut My World EP, weíve had My World 2.0, two remix albums, a compilation album (because every career that is over an album and a half long obviously becomes in dire need of compiling), and nothing less than a full-length documentary of the boyís personal life. In other words, if ever a competition were to be held to decide the worldís most shamelessly exploited celebrity appeal, Mr Bieberís would be a serious contender.

With that in mind, the biggest surprise of all, really, ends up being the fact that Island Records have waited this long to land an album like Under the Mistletoe on our collective heads. After all, what would make tweenage girls happier than a combination of two of their favourite things i.e Justin Bieber and Christmas at the same time"" It makes absolute sense to put the two of them together, and as fast as possible at that. To that end, Mistletoe ñ which is incidentally, and quite strangely, Justin Bieberís de facto sophomore album (by virtue of the fact that the artist has done nothing more than simply retweak his material over the past couple of years) ñ will undoubtedly end up achieving two things by the time its run is over: a thorough and holistic affirmation of love for all things Bieber from the pop starís legions of fans, and serious agitation on the part of those folks who find themselves cringing and wincing each time some faceless DJ decides to spin his music in shopping malls. 

While it is rare (or at least, relatively uncommon) for an artistís general reception to fall so quickly and so easily into such differing extremes, careful examination of Bieberís rise to fame (and his subsequent attempts to stay there) suggests that it should be no surprise that the line between love and hate ends up being quite thin in Bieberís case. Letís begin at the beginning: at the tender age of 13, Justin Drew Bieber was discovered by former So So Def marketing executive Scooter Braun, who clicked on one of his home made videos by accident whilst looking up another artist on YouTube. One thing led to another, and before the year was out, Bieber was on his way to Atlanta to record demo tapes. But while Bieber wasnít the first ñ and most assuredly wonít be the last ñ of aspiring bedroom musicians to use the video-sharing website as an initial springboard for popularity, unlike many of those other wannabe artists, Bieber is increasingly starting to show that he does not deserve a single ounce of the critical acclaim that he has received. Such an outcome is itself a gross violation of the very meaning of artistic expression, and not only because he frequently creates the type of soulless, cheap-trick commodity that excites none but the lowest common denominator, but also because every inch of his current persona appears to have been callously slipped upon him ñ like a loosely-fitting pair of pajamas ñ by a backing agency that doesnít seem to care a single jot about artistic integrity.

Which brings us back to Under the Mistletoe. Obviously, thereís nothing particularly strange or alien about a record company cashing in on the excuse to shop that is Christmastime ñ corporations of all sorts have been doing that for ages. In fact, in many instances they help form the essence of the joys of giving and receiving that make each festive season an event worth looking forward to. Itís the same reason why the rentals of holiday-related movies spike astronomically at this exact same time every single year: we want to get in the mood and connect with those around us. Decades of consumer study have thoroughly educated the retail industry on what makes us tick in family-oriented times like these, allowing them to capitalize on our greatest and most innate desires. Having done so, these companies necessarily agree to take on the burden of ensuring that that same message of mutual love and togetherness is not buried under the temptation to embark on a round of rampant profit-making. In other words: in return for sincere, well-thought-out products, we will give you our turkey (no pun intended). 

Justin Bieber and Island Records could have so easily created an album based on such a guiding spirit. Instead they chose to take the easy way out and stuff Under the Mistletoe full of phoned-in and blatantly disingenuous tracks. That selfish decision to prioritize their coffers - and destroy the spirit of festivity in its name - is the prism through which Under the Mistletoe must be judged. No other track reflects the utter deservedness of this sentiment more than the absolutely awful re-recording of Mariah Careyís ìAll I Want For Christmas Is Youî, which sees Bieber perform a duet with the American singer-songwriter herself. For most of the number, the pair barely sound like they're on the same wavelength; the songís introduction, for instance, sounds like a dry run gone badly out of sync, with both Carey and Bieber taking turns to blubber over each otherís vocal parts like a pair of kids competing to see who can come up with the most extravagant claim about their respective fathers. 

Equally as criminal is the completely unnecessary inclusion of yet another rendition of ìSilent Nightî; apart from the songís placement at the end of the album adding credence to the overwhelming suspicion that it was slipped in as a mere stopgap measure to make the entire album seem a bit more Christmassy, Bieberís performance also comes across as more subdued rather than emotional, as if he had been forced to perform it against his own will. Now, to be completely fair, that was probably the case. But donít let that sentiment lead to even the slightest notion that Bieber should be let off the hook, for all throughout this record there is a strong sense that the artist could have really used this opportunity to develop his own craft. Having already successfully dealt with a breaking voice and commendably coped with his new-found status as the latest global phenomenon, the next step for Bieber, logically, would be to attempt to expand his palette and try out a few new things. But the apparent ease in which Bieber rejected that option entirely before proceeding to recreate a new catalogue filled to no end with perfidious pop songs like ìOnly Thing I Ever Get For Christmasî and ìMistletoeî is to walk the path of the damned. 

Elsewhere, even the presence of various big name stars fails to disguise the obvious sense of theatrical festivity present herein. So Usher, Boyz II Men, and Busta Rhymes feature on this album. Big deal. In a world of perfect justice, these artists would be ridiculed for having associated themselves with Justin Bieber. Obviously, that will never happen, so hereís what we should do in the meantime: until Justin Bieber decides to take himself seriously, the rest of us shouldnít as well. Such an approach certainly isnít pretty. Itís not even nice. But itís a message well worth sending: mess with our familial sensibilities again, and the coal sitting in your stockings will be the least of your worries."
neg,"Under the Mistletoe offers the Biebertron in holiday mode, piping his way through 11 standards and originals with the help of half a dozen famous buddies, whose performances generally outclass his by quite a stretch. The guests are the album's saving grace. Only half the tracks feature Bieber on his own ñ of these, the acoustic Silent Night is most likely to have Beliebers swooning ñ and they pale next to Fa La La, with its twinkling Boyz II Men harmonies, and his duet with Mariah Carey. Bieber actually holds his own against her gusty attack, but he's no match for Usher's lounge-soul suppleness on The Christmas Song or Busta Rhymes's raucous flow on Drummer Boy. Bieber could well turn into something interesting one day, but until he does, you wouldn't want to spend too long under the mistletoe with him."
pos,"I previously rated this album as 5/10, however after listening I have to revise my review to 9/10, coldplay often surprises pleasantly after listening to their albums repeatedly. Gotta say this album is really pretty good actually, not quite up to par with Viva, but great stuff, I totally take back my first review."
pos,"Such a great album! I fell in love with this thing, it's the best the boys have done after X&Y... Go and enjoy this little piece of music! I you feel disappointid right now, please give it time to grow on you. I'm sure it will grow on you. You've got to all the details and layers in the songs, it will amaze you for sure!"
pos,Good Album! one of the best of the year by far! definitely suggest buying it! you won't regret it! they did a fantastic job!
pos,"mylo xyloto its an awesome album and does it have so meanful alternative ballads.The songs that i like the most are Charlie Brown,Hurts Like Heaven Princess of China"
pos,"This is a great album! I'm proud to be a fan of Coldplay because they always move forward with their experimentation. Mylo Xyloto is a great example of new and old Coldplay styles. Songs like ""U.F.O."" and ""Us Against The World"" show the old acoustic Coldplay from 2002 and the new 2011 Coldplay. I do have a problem with ""Princess of China"" though. Why? Why would you bring Rihanna and not Beyonce to sing on this song? I don't like the fact that Chris only sing's a verse and then Rihanna overtakes the entire song. It's listenable but not the best song on the album. ""Don't Let It Break Your Heart"" is a great upbeat song for all to enjoy. Coldplay are best at writing upbeat song's with sad lyrics, like ""Every Teardrop"". ""Major Minus"" is just full blown paranoia on Martin's part, with his muffled vocals in the background, nearly overshadowed by Jonny Buckland's front seat guitar playing. ""Paradise"" and ""Charlie Brown"" are perfect examples of where Coldplay could go new with their songwriting along with ""Hurts Like Heaven"", their fastest song ever. This does happen to be a loosely based concept album, telling the tale of two lost souls who find each other in their horrible world and ""Up With The Birds"" is a perfect way to end the album with it's joyful lyrics ""good things are coming our way"" and it's simple piano outro sum up the album perfectly. This will be able to keep you satisfied until a possible sixth studio album is in the works! 9/10"
pos,"I am a longtime Coldplay fan ever since the release of their debut album Parachutes. Some would describe Mylo Xyloto as a mixture of dance songs, intimate acoustic songs, and pop songs. One thing is for certain, the style is a departure from their previous albums. But does the style work? In my opinion, yes, Coldplay have pulled it off flawlessly. Maybe the songs are not of a melancholic feel like that of A Rush of Blood to the Head (their best critically reviewed album), but here in this album, we have optimism. Even though the emotion they are evoking is not melancholy, Coldplay can not simply be written off. This album will definitely alienate some of the old school Coldplay fans (I being an old school Coldplay was not alienated though) but it will also bring in some new Coldplay fans. Coldplay have grown musically with stand out tracks like Hurts like Heaven, Major Minus, Us Against the World, Charlie Brown, Don't Let it Break Your Heart, and Up with the Birds. That is half of the album containing standout tracks, and the rest of them are REALLY good. All Coldplay listeners need to do is embrace this new style (because it will not stick. I won't be surprised if the next album is of a completely different style) and learn to love this album because of the story it tells. It is not like that of many albums that have been released lately. Coldplay have learned that in order to have relevance in the music world, you have to grow musically and not always keep the same style. The production on the album gives it an atmospheric feel, almost an ""out of this world, supernatural"" type of feel. Unlike their previous album Viva la Vida, which had a more classical feel with the prominent use of strings in a lot of songs, Mylo Xyloto incorporates the use of synths and electronic instruments to a greater use and they are brought to the fore. Songs like Princess of China and Paradise will be hated from some fans for the simple reason that it does not sound like Coldplay and even bringing on Rihanna to be featured on one of the songs. But do not be afraid, for there are many songs on this album that sound like classic Coldplay, those being: Charlie Brown, U.F.O., Us Against the World, and Up with the Birds. Mylo Xyloto contains many layers in all of their songs, which have angered many fans and critics to calling it ""over-produced."" I feel the many layers adds color and character to the songs. Many songs on the album are not simple, they contain a lot of instrument tracks. Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, capitalized on the fact that it's songs contained simple tracks. This is not the ""Parachutes Coldplay."" That does not bother me though, because you are never bored with the songs and there is always something going on. All in all, Coldplay have recorded an amazing album. It is not their best, but it is definitely their second best (A Rush of Blood to the Head being first, and Mylo Xyloto tied for second with Viva la Vida). Mylo Xyloto shows character, color, and optimism and cements Coldplay still as the greatest band in the world."
neg,"Richard Ashcroft responds to the failure of the Verve v. 3.0  with an album of excitable, populist electro-soul.
The Verve's third and presumably final era (2007-2009) yielded a quality Verve album-- it's just that it was made by the Big Pink. The success of the London duo's A Brief History of Love proved there was still a demand for those bygone qualities-- anthemic choruses, stadium-rattling drums, and a cosmic grandeur-- that made the Verve's Urban Hymns a late-1990s totem. Alas, those qualities were at a premium on the Verve's own unfocused 2008 comeback effort, Forth. Whether or not singer Richard Ashcroft was taking notes on his Big Pink progeny, he's responded to Verve v. 3.0's aborted mission with an album of excitable, populist electro-soul. But if Forth sounded like a half-hearted attempt to recapture the early Verve's free-form spirit, Ashcroft's maiden voyage with his new band, RPA & the United Nations of Sound, is sunk by a grating, calculated over-eagerness to please.
Listening to United Nations of Sound, it becomes increasingly clear that the Verve's recurring cycle of make-ups and break-ups probably has less to do with the notoriously thorny relationship between Ashcroft and guitarist Nick McCabe, and more to do with providing Ashcroft with a rebirth narrative for his subsequent solo ventures. Just as his 2000 solo debut, Alone With Everybody, hinged on the leaf-turning track ""Brave New World"", United Nations of Sound arrives with a Sunday-school sermon's worth of resurrection rhetoric that conflates Ashcroft's return with that of J.C. himself.
Ashcroft's next coming is heralded by dense, busy productions-- courtesy of Kanye West associate No ID-- that draw as much from the slow-jam grind of modern R&B and the six-string squeal of 1980s hair-metal as the lush 70s orchestro-soul that the singer favors. Yet for all of Ashcroft's messianic posturing, these songs are all dressed up with nothing to say. The initially momentous opener ""Are You Ready""-- essentially the Verve's ""Bittersweet Symphony"" cross-wired with Primal Scream's ""Loaded""-- has already played its hand halfway through its six-minute run, leaving Ashcroft to repeat variations on the title ad nauseum before yielding to an inconsequential extended guitar solo. Elsewhere, he sounds like he's expending more energy on investing every ad-libbed ""ooh"" and ""yeah"" with forced profundity than on his songwriting-- on two tracks (""Born Again"", ""This Thing Called Life"") he lazily opts out of completing a four-line stanza to let out a phlegmy ""aaahhhnnn."" And this is to say nothing of the songs that turn out to be every bit as ill-advised as their titles (the chest-pumping tech-rocker ""Beatitudes"", the toothless John Lee Hooker rip ""How Deep Is Your Man"")."

There's nothing here but an attempt to be like everybody: dull, plastic, monotonous, and not a sign of life...not one sign of the Dirty Vegas I once knew."

An album that gets better with each listening live and work songs. You can check this on the last rock in the river where the Coldplay concert was the highlight of the festival."
pos,"I will start out by saying I became a Coldplay fan because of Viva La Vida, and I still believe that it is their best and most artistically accomplished album. The albums preceding are of varying quality to me, with Parachutes being a melancholy bore, Rush of Blood to the Head a mixed bag of their signature indie soft ballads and the early signs of their arena-rock sound, and X&Y the perfect combination of those two elements albeit lacking the vision of greater artists. Then Viva La Vida came along and showcased the band's ability to forge a new sound without completely abolishing the styles of their past. There are a few minor missteps musically, but overall the album is their most complete and accomplished work. Three years later, Mylo Xyloto is released, and with it the band has made another attempt to forge a new sound. They have taken on the pop sounds of the day; electronica, europop, r&b; and combined them with the soft ballads and arena rock that has come to define them. Musically, the album contains some truly great pieces, particularly in terms of composition and melody. ""Paradise"" is one of the best singles the band has ever produced, simple but layered and emotionally uplifting in a way only Coldplay can be. ""Charlie Brown"" contains a great core melody, and I already find myself humming the tune. The biggest surprise for me is the song ""Princess of China;"" who would have thought a pop/r&b slow breakup jam with a Rihanna appearance would make such a great tune, but it is indeed one of the album's best. For me the album succeeds in its overall concept, tone and style. Where the album stumbles is in the moments where the band reverts back to their old habits, evidenced in the A-side tune ""Us Against the World"" and the B-side ""U.F.O."" Both are slow, somber acoustic pieces, and not only kill the pace and cohesion of the other tunes but are just not up to par with earlier Coldplay classics in the same vein. However, the album is able to overcome these and still feel whole, and the beautiful ""Up with the Birds"" is a perfect close; it personifies what I believe is Coldplay's greatest strength, their ability to convey emotion and always with a tone of hope. Simply, give the album a listen or two or three. Take it for what it is, not what you expect it to be. Hopefully you will find that it is another very good album from one of the great bands currently making music."
pos,"This album is Coldplay's most confident and unashamed mini masterpiece. Hopeful, uplifting, sad, interesting and ultimately consistently well crafted throughout. There is no bad song (major minus could have been replaced with moving to mars although Bucklands' riff is sublime) - it's concept fades and emboldened - rightfully- is the beautiful chemistry of a band writing superb music. Their most interesting and addictive effort yet! Hurts Like Heaven, Charlie Brown and Teardrop particular stand outs."
pos,"Mylo Xyloto is probably their best album yet.Ya sure,it doesn't change much in terms of musical style,compared to lets say X and Y and Viva La Vida,which saw the band take a huge leap in a new direction,but rather it builds upon an already solid foundation left behind by the last album,and to a lesser extent,the ones before,and is that really that bad."
pos,"Few artists are capable of achieving the promise of their beginnings. Fewer still can sustain this acme of achievement over time. Rare is the talent that paints the musical canvas of a time, song by song without faltering. Where Viva la Vida pronounced Coldplay's ascension to these heights, Mylo Xyloto assures the permanence of that lofty position. Not content to merely churn out more of the same, Coldplay has stretched the method and expanded the musical horizon, blending rhythms, melodies and harmonies spanning a variety of genres while still maintaining their essence. Just a Revolver & Sgt. Pepper pronounced The Beatles ascension in 1966-67, the White Album cemented their position in a place where others could not follow. Coldplay is now in their company. Yet, just as with The Beatles.......as Coldplay continues to expand horizons, grow and progress.......fans stuck in the original style, delivery and motifs of their music.......will long for a return to what was. Yet it is in embracing the freedom to grow and explore that the true essence of musical creativity and genius is realized and can be truly appreciated. "

neg,Like sticking your finger up your butt.
neg,"Dirty Vegas' debut was built around the dreamy, semi-mysterious single ""Days Go By,"" a slick slice of dance-pop that sold a bunch of Mitsubishis and excused the band's shortcomings. Lyrically they were no threat to Dylan, but that didn't matter much when all the pings and pongs echoed gracefully and synths conjured up beautifully detached, nocturnal landscapes. Now they've returned with the heartfelt album One, which is filled with guitars and oh so serious, and delivered by bandmembers who are much better programmers than they are storytellers. There are hints of late-period New Order and Duran Duran on One, but none of the excitement with each wistful and maudlin track blending into the next. ""Couldn't help it if I tried,"" ""I can't stop this feeling,"" ""Nothing ever lasts forever,"" and ""The only thing worth living for is love"" are just some of the numerous clichÈs used for the lyrics, and while some tracks are entirely built from them, Dirty Vegas could have just barely pulled it off if they had pulled out the old drum machine. As a guitar-based band, they have no style, and there's no evidence of inspiration guiding the beat combo switchover. One fulfills all of the ""faceless"" criticisms thrown at them in the past, while alienating whatever fan base they had before."
neg,"For the past couple of years, many obituaries have been written for guitar-orientated bands in mainstream UK music. I emphasise the word mainstream because a quick rummage through the blogosphere on sites like this would suggest the homegrown underground scene - whether it be guitar-driven or otherwise - is as healthy as it's ever been these past 40 years. Lurking around the capital are excellent offerings by The Horrors and Male Bonding - both of whom have churned out two impressive records in the space of two years - will immediately slap you around the face. Head up the M1 and Leeds can boast an unparalleled wealth of talent ranging from Pulled Apart By Horses and Dinosaur Pile-Up's punk-ravaged metal to Spectrals' oblique retro-inspired pop and beyond. Head even further north and you'll encounter The Chapman Family wrestling with their conscience and microphone leads, Wild Beasts' Cumbrian eccentricity, The Twilight Sad shattering eardrums and We Were Promised Jetpacks about to release one of 2011's real gems. Even my neck of the woods in the East Midlands is currently at its most vibrant thanks to the impending progress of Dog Is Dead, Spotlight Kid and Swimming, with a host of others ready to break out in their trail. I could go on for hours co-ordinating each and every crevice of the British Isles while unearthing a plethora of other like-minded souls but I won't, as ultimately making lists is something to do before you go supermarket shopping. However, one thing that links all of the aforementioned is that their output is created predominantly using the guitar. Which not only renders the ""Is guitar music dead?"" argument null and void, but also begs me to ask a further question; what the hell was going through the A&R department's minds at Geffen Records in October of last year?
That was when some record executive decided that (allegedly) half-a-million pounds of the company's money should be invested in 'Slough's finest' (their words not mine), the then simply monikered Brother. Exactly what potential the label's talent scouts saw here - and let's not forget this is the corporation responsible for financing such groundbreaking records as Reign In Blood, Goo, Nevermind and In Utero among many, many others - only they can answer. As misguided as a desperate football manager staring relegation in the face making panic buys on the final day of the January transfer window, Geffen's belief that this lot represent the future of UK guitar music defies comprehension.
Marketed as the missing link between Oasis and Blur's era-defining stand-off at the height of Britpop and the scuzzy posturing of The Libertines, we could also talk at length about Brother's past lives until the cows come home, but as that's also been discussed at length elsewhere it would prove little more than a fruitless retread. Indeed, that's probably something that shouldn't be held against this band; people's tastes change, new ideas developed. After all, would Radiohead still be held in the same high esteem if they'd spent their first four years together churning out replicated versions of Pablo Honey? Precisely. No, what's more alarming is that Brother's (we'll get to the 'Viva' bit soon) 'development' feels more like a regression than a genuine attempt at artistic growth. Whereas the musical style they were peddling at the outset owed more to the sounds of downtown New Jersey circa 2004, the 2010 variation culminating in Geffen's costly endorsement became redundant at one minute past midnight on 22nd August 1997, precisely 24 hours after the world had heard Be Here Now switch Britpop's life support machine off at the mains.
So, as everyone from the media to radio pluggers to the record buying public takes turns in deciding who to point the finger at for inflicting these gobshites on the world in the first place, it really is difficult to see beyond the record label for such an ill-advised, surely finance-driven business decision. Sure, the band themselves come across as being a little desperate for success, but it's hardly their fault they've come this far.
Of course there will be some who'll bemoan the fact Brother seemed cursed from the start. They'll talk about the decline in record sales as an excuse for none of their three singles to date reaching the Top 40, blame the music press for commissioning a wave of negative publicity from the outset and point to the fact that even Australian bands with a fondness for New Model Army and The Levellers claimed the band's name some twenty years previous, hence the newly christened Viva Brother. However, for the industry to prosper, it's also in everyone's best interests for an expensive failure like this to occur. After all, one can barely imagine the other dross that may have been signed up by Geffen's rivals had everything gone to plan? Unless by some unexplainable quirk of fate VB disappear for two years only to return and ""do a Horrors"", their place in rock's Good Ship Oblivion is already laid out and waiting.
There isn't really an awful lot else to say. Famous First Words might not be the worst record you'll hear this year, but it's certainly one of the most pointless. Derivative to the point of being permanently stuck in reverse gear, it's a record that oozes predictability and little besides. In fact, rather than me waffle on about how the breakdown in 'Darling Buds Of May' steals directly from 'Supersonic' or the way 'Electric Daydream' sounds like a pastiche of 'Go Let It Out' - itself a poorly constructed copy of its creators' former glories, have a listen for yourselves if you're really that intrigued. I dare you."
neg,"Slough has always had a bad rep. Usually this comes from the kind people who have never been there and are only too quick to recite lines about friendly bombs and the lack of bovine grazing opportunities from John Betjemenís notorious poem. Granted, the majority of its population have little to say by way of praise either: this writer once met an embarrassed individual at a party who claimed to hail from the non-existent ìNorth Etonî.

However, speaking as someone who was born and bred there and legged it at the first opportunity, it can be confirmed that this transient, industrial nightmare still had much to recommend it. The Slough of my youth was a multi-cultural mix made up of post-war migrants only too willing to roll up their sleeves in order to provide for their offspring. Growing up among kids from different cultures did much to open my eyes to a whole wide world. It may also come as a surprise to the casual observer that the town was once home to a vibrant music scene, and while nobody really broke through to a wider audience, there were enough local heroes and parties to ensure that some twisted form of civic pride was firmly in place.

So when the existence of Viva Brother ñ nee Brother ñ came to these ears, there was a genuine sense of excitement that the home of one of Europeís largest industrial estates might finally be seen as something other than the location of Ricky Gervaisí planet-shagging sitcom. Yet even before the expose of their revisionist past, alarms bells began to ring. The unintentionally hilarious YouTube videos of four lads sloping around the Trading Estate, train station and other local landmarks telling whoever would listen of their plans of global domination smacked of contrivance. What little music was on offer simply elicited the response of ìYeah, and..?î

And so finally their debut album is here. Yet for all their bluster of writing anthems for a new generation and saving guitar music, the reality is little more than a damp squib. If one were being generous, their attempt at reviving the spirit of Cool Britannia could seem understandable, forgivable even. They are, after all, part of the generation that grew up in the slipstream of Oasisí magpie antics. If Viva Brother were inspired by that stitched together Frankensteinís Monster of music that ran riot with nary a thought for creativity or artistic expression, then their default setting of swagger, guitars and button-down shirts ought to make sense. Except it doesnít: as we all know, their attempts at emo and whatever else was lying around smacks of previous attempts to become pop stars at all costs.

So what of the music? Anthemic? Powerful? Uplifting? Sadly not. Itís the kind of pumped-up jingle-jangle indie one would expect from a project that has producer Stephen Streetís name attached it. As evidenced by ëStill Hereí, the 60s are plundered without rhyme or reason in the shape of a grotesque steal from the Stonesí ëSympathy For The Devilí while its opening couplet of ìYou take my money and you burn it to the ground / Itís no inferno but it follows me aroundî is simply laughable. Yet that is William Shakespeare when compared to ëDarling Buds Of Mayí which has ìHer birthdayís in May / It is what it is / It is what it isî for your amusement and/ or incredulity. Similarly, despite ëNew Yearís Dayíís reaching for the pints aloft bonhomie of the stroke midnight it succeeds only in knocking over a half full can of stale ale.

And so it goes over and over and over again across the duration of Viva Brotherís pedestrian muzak. These arenít famous first words or even rock & roll for that matter. This is manufactured rebellion for the X Factor generation and thatís just not good enough in times like these. Devoid of hunger, anger and sex, Viva Brother are about as anaemic and pale as music gets.

Slough has always had a bad rep and Famous First Words is going to do little to change that. Cheers, lads."
neg,"Viva Brother are the latest UK hype band to emerge seemingly from nowhere, this time making self-proclaimed ""Grit Pop."" The term is an obvious nod to Britpop but also to their hometown of Slough (which, by the way, still isn't half as gritty as Pulp's early 1990s Sheffield). A large part of how they have made it this far has to do with their loudmouth posturing in the British indie press and in public starting their second ever gig with the line ""If anyone here doesnít want to see the future of music, leave now.""
That kind of sassy talk has polarized the UK press but at least puts them leagues ahead of countless other faceless major label bands in the personality game. However, all that bluster and boasting comes undone when listening to Famous First Words and you realise they actually don't have anything to say at all. The songs range from a parade of clichÈs to the plain ridiculous, none more so than ""I met the mermaid and I showed her just how to run,"" from ""False Alarm"", a song that also relays an imagined conversation with a tornado. Those kind of ideas come across as an unintentionally hilarious attempt to out-stupid Oasis at their most obtuse, but even the Gallaghers had enough sense to qualify their non-sequiturs with lines about getting high. Also, at least somebody in ""Champagne Supernova"" was having fun, because let's be clear-- nobody on this record is having fun, not you the listener nor any member of Viva Brother.
Musically, things are just as drab and any hint of an interesting idea on Famous First Words can easily traced back to a much more appealing root. Take opening track ""New Year's Day"" for example and its wordless chorus, lifted almost directly from the coda of Blur's ""Girls and Boys"", but replacing that bands cheeky charm with try-hard conviction. And then there's ""Otherside"", which opens with a promising Chameleons-like guitar line before descending into yet more chugging guitar and infant grade lyrics. This time Newell recounts the places he has been leaving his head-- at the end of the phone, by a bedside light-- before sneering ""I got a job/ That I don't want"". It's pretty brainless stuff, the special kind that makes you feel somehow stupider for having listened.
Look, It's easy to see why Viva Brother were given a shot at the big time-- the dual allure of a Britpop revival and four arrogant young men with guitars must have been impossible for record execs to resist. But in execution the whole thing comes off as nothing more than a thinly disguised, crass attempt to smoke latent Oasis fans out of hiding. Unfortunately for them, Beady Eye already beat them to the punch."
neg,"Rarely does even the British music press set upon a record with the kind of savagery that has been reserved for Viva Brother's dÈbut. Having been signed by Geffen on the back of airing of their demo on BBC Radio 1, the band ñ who would still be known simply as ìBrotherî were it not for a conflict with an Australian group with that name ñ are now the music hack's go-to whipping boys. Widely mocked since their laughable declaration at an early gig that anyone who didn't ìwant to see the future of musicî should leave, Viva Brother would have been up for a critical mauling if they produced anything less than rock's second coming.
It's no surprise, then, that their album of drab '90s revivalism has been named as one of the worst British efforts of the year, but that doesn't make it true. It's a safe bet, for example, that Cher Lloyd, perpetrator of astonishingly awful current UK #1 single ìSwagger Jaggerî, will put out an LP this year that makes Famous First Words seem like the White Album. No, the accolade Viva Brother and their dÈbut are still very much in the running for is a less coveted one. This is one of the most pale and uninspired records from an apparently serious rock band for some time.
That Viva Brother were aping that elusive Cool Britannia era was clear from the first passages of their strange story, but the true extent and depth of their Britpop forgery was concealed until now. The band's ruthless poaching from Oasis, Blur and Pulp has failed to transfer any of the swagger, wit or charm from those bands, leaving them with soulless husks of songs that wouldn't withstand consideration for Shed Seven B-sides and certainly don't belong on a purportedly listenable commercial rock album. What does it say about this band when even their album's cover is surely a knock-off of Mumford & Sons' Sigh No More, with real people replaced by flat, black and white photographs?
Producer Stephen Street, who has worked with Kaiser Chiefs and the Smiths among others, puts in a Herculean effort and almost succeeds in making something credible of all the inanely chugging guitars and directionless, wailing vocals. His efforts are in vain, however, and to have played Fifth Beatle for Viva Brother will, no doubt, sadly remain a black mark on his record for years to come. Ultimately the band themselves will take the brunt of the blame for the crimes committed here and foremost among those is unquestionably the lyrics.
Oh, the lyrics. The infamous first words set to mediocrity here are of that special sort that don't so much insult your intelligence as actively leech it away, comprised as they are of some of the most nonsensical phrases ever juxtaposed. ìIt takes a moron to know oneî, frontman Lee Newell wails in a rare moment of clarity, ìand he knows meî. A little earlier on the record, ìStill Hereî stands almost as a monument to comical songwriting starting with the lines, ìyou take my money and burn it to the ground / it's no inferno but it follows me aroundî.
The lyrics, in fact, are reason enough to ignore claims that Famous First Words isn't worth your time. So hilarious is Viva Brother's addled logic that finding a way to stream it for free is actually highly recommended. As a record that Geffen plus Newell and co expect anyone to pay for, though, this album is a distillation of all that is wrong with British guitar music, peddled by a band so consumed by their own deluded egotism that they think of themselves as its saviours. Whether to laugh or cry is your choice to make."
neg,"Forced to change their name from Brother, when an Australian roots-rock combo consulted m'learned friends, this Slough guitar-pop combo settled on Viva Brother instead of following the example of The Charlatans UK or London Suede.

Then again, who'd want to listen to Brother Slough? Especially if they sounded as bereft of character as this quartet of brash, self-consciously bratty chancers, who are fatally mired in hackneyed Britpop mannerisms. Strident guitars and harmonies tug one's sleeve, eager for attention they don't merit, while the lyrics seem to be about nothing, mere excuses for refrains like ""I said, ooh, shine it out today, throw it all away..."" (""False Alarm"") and the claim in ""High Street Low Lives"" that ""Life's too short, and I'm too high, and nobody's getting out of line"". Well, not on this sorry album, certainly."
neg,"At the start of 2011, Berkshire chancers Brother launched themselves at the knuckledragger market temporarily vacated by the Gallaghers, declaring themselves ""the future of music"".
Since then, they've become a standing joke and ignominiously had to add 'Viva' to their name for legal reasons. This debut is so lame, it makes the Beady Eye album sound like Let It Bleed: ten pieces of chugging Brit-rock so soul-crushingly doctrinaire they make Cast sound like Captain Beefheart. Meanwhile, singer Leonard Newell's flimsy Liam impression is the audio equivalent of that squint-eyed sneer he affects in every single photo shoot.
They do have the self-awareness to quote Betjeman's ""Slough"" on ""High Street Low Lives"", but if these jokers succeed, those friendly bombs came too late. The chances? Not so much Definitely Maybe as Definitely No Way."
neg,"You might just have heard of Viva Brother, a tough-talking Slough four-piece in thrall to the melodic brawn of Oasis. Until recently, they were known as Brother, before being forced into an unflattering name-change by a globally renowned Celtic-Australian didgeridoo outfit.
Now, though, Viva Brother find themselves the subject of another minor controversy. Instead of ushering in a revival of Britpop as they intended, their debut album, Famous First Words, seems, instead, to sound a kind of death knell for British guitar rock.
At the end of last year, Brother were talking themselves up as the vanguard of an early-90s revival. You could just about see their logic. The Suede reunion (or at least the second coming of Suede's latter incarnation) was gathering pace. Blur had proved there was a live audience for their hits, even after a decade of Gorillaz.Pop had become an arena dominated by solo females and urban crossovers, a state of affairs that usually paves the way nicely for a guitar backlash. Indie circles, meanwhile, have been rife with rekindlings of the C86 sound and shoegaze rock. Surely Cool Britannia, Slight Return was only just around the corner? Accordingly, Brother styled themselves as the upstart younger siblings of Oasis, a band photographed in their early days wearing Manchester City shirts with a sponsor's name ñ Brother ñ emblazoned on the front. This passed for wit at the time.
But Brother, some might say, failed to read the signs. The public appetite for Oasis has waned so much that Beady Eye, their successors, haven't taken off. Another self-styled band of the people, the Courteeners, have been slouching along to general indifference for years. Does anyone even remember the Ordinary Boys?
Moreover, Viva Brother's works are so mimetic they make you long for Noel Gallagher's pastiches of the Beatles. His first solo album, incidentally, is out in October.
So: not only is Viva Brother a bad name for a bad band executing a bad idea, badly; Famous First Words is also a bad title for a bad album. Witness ""Darling Buds of May"", an Oasis brass-rubbing whose chorus runs thus: ""Her birthday's in May/It is what it is/It is what it is."" Or take ""New Year's Day"", a song that attempts to graft the camp ""owh-owh-owh"" start of a Suede song on to a ditty constructed by Random Gallagher Tombola.
The ""Viva"" slapped on to the beginning of their name is all wrong: too redolent of a rugged Spanish resistance romance for songwriters whose idea of a mordant title is ""High Street Low Lives"". There's one quite good line in ""Still Here"", a passive-aggressive love song: ""At my funeral, they'll bury just my head in the sand.""
It all makes the Vaccines ñ the mildly successful great white guitar hopes of 2011, from the fringe'n'drainpipes side of the rock tracks ñ look original. Ultimately, Famous First Words sets the cause of resurgent guitar rock backÖ ooh, a good 20 years."
neg,"My initial thoughts when taking on this record to review was that it would be fun to take the knives out and give them a good sharpening in preparation for the inevitable slaughtering. However, I decided to approach this record with a fresh and sincere mindset; morons are after all due a fair trial and still capable of producing good music.
I wish I hadnít. Straight off: this album is an abomination. Itís a rancid pile of regurgitated tripe.
Viva Brother (Formerly Brother) are a self proclaimed ëGrit-popí band. The analysis of their own music is actually pretty spot-on, it is indeed an amalgamation of Brit-Pop and some salty-gritty-shit you find in bins on street corners that you throw out onto the road to be trodden on.
This so-called ëreinventioní of Brit Pop is perhaps the most frustrating element to the bandís perception. Itís no re-birth, itís not a bunch of young kids discovering a series of bands from a long gone era and feeling so inspired by them that they want to breathe life into its forgotten legend. Itís a bunch of guys around my age who were alive and kicking for Brit-Pop and experienced it, but were simply not old enough to go out and enjoy and embrace it fully. They are simply people with regressive tastes, mindsets and attitudes. They are the same people who drunkenly scream at and hassle DJs for Oasis and Stone Roses in every bar they go to because in their world they are still bands that are not only still relevant but also somehow fundamental.
Delving into individual songs here would be somewhat pointless; itís all a huge congealed glob of football terrace chants put to music. Apart from Fly By Nights which sounds like Reef, and that may even be the greatest compliment on the record. Most worrying is what they actually hear in their influences, the Blur rip-offs are undeniable but lack any semblance to the charm that soaked said band. Rarely do the band ever sound like anything beyond a 90s indie karaoke outing but with instruments.
Stephen Streetís production is quite frankly ghastly. Itís almost as though he has had a gun pointed at his head by the band whilst screaming, ìMake us sound like everything shit about the nineties but worseî. In all fairness, he has succeeded triumphantly.
The lyrics succeed. They succeed in being so painfully child-like, banal and turgid that suddenly reading the contents of a shampoo bottle is like clasping a copy of a signed first edition by Dostoevsky.
Ultimately, this feels like a bunch of misguided opportunists who in the wake of the Oasissplit have thought that suddenly the world is lacking in a Liam Gallagher-type gobshite telling everyone how great they are. Well, while Liam is an undeniable gobshite, heís a gobshite with personality and this band and this album are so lacking in personality they may as well be trying to rip off Daniel OíDonnell rather than Oasis.
The zero rating may seem like an obvious one, in an attempt to jump on the bandwagon to the slaughterhouse, but this album is bad. Not only is the album bad, no... awful, actually no... repugnant. It is also what it represents that is equally offensive ñ their approach is almost thug-like ñ self-declarations of genius and wonderment whilst behaving in a manner that can only be described as threatening. While everything about the persona of Viva Brother may scream ëLike us or elseÖí the content has nothing to say at all."
pos,"This album is truly amazing. It is Coldplay trying out new things, while still being awesome as always. Beautiful. I cannot wait for them to come to Edmonton for a live show. On all the videos I have seen, Chris's singing is perfectly on pitch and it sounds like the albums. Viva la Coldplay!"
pos,"I think its amazing how sure of them selves people can be when it comes to music. To review an album takes time, and you have to be objective. I dont see a lot of reviews that has that in mind. They know, they know and this is how it is. If u think other wise you are an idiot, it seems. Well, I have spent time on this album, u can trust me on that. I don know if i am right but here it is:
Mylo xyloto, compared to coldplay and their earlier work is a 5. Mylo Xyloto compared too all the other music out there is a sure ten. There u have it:) Respect!"
pos,"Ok, Mylo Xyloto does not sound like ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" or any other Coldplay Album. I am a fan of Coldplay since parachutes and there is not much to say about Mylo Xyloto. Just one Word: Amazing."
pos,Mylo Xyloto is Coldplay finally being comfortable as a ''pop' band. They took their experimentation in Viva La Vida and took it into a more 'digestible' body of work. The end result sits above 'X&Y' but still below 'A Rush of Blood to the Head'. Is it the best album of the year? Maybe not. Is it one of the most enjoyable? I certainly think so.
neg,"This is a joke, surely? Also, I don't hate the album just because of critical reception, I've heard the album. Imagine if Oasis's first album was Standing on the shoulders of giants and their albums went downhill in the same way, well this is what their 4th album would be like. A pointless attempt at invoking some feeling of nostalgia."
neg,"Katy Perry achieved maturation with Prism, the 2013 album anchored on the self-empowerment anthem ""Roar"" and the club smash ""Dark Horse."" Considering how ""Roar"" scored the closing stages of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, it would've seemed like a logical move for Perry to build upon its adult alternative affirmation but she's instead chosen to use ""Dark Horse"" as a blueprint for Witness, the long-awaited 2017 successor to Prism. Perhaps Perry shifted her approach after ""Rise,"" the ""Roar""-alike written for the 2016 Olympics that she also performed at that year's Democratic National Convention, failed to crack the Top Ten, perhaps she always planned to construct this album with electronic beats and synths, but Witness is so slick with synths it seems slippery. It also feels relentless and a shade desperate. Some of this is due to timing. Arriving on the heels of Prism, a record littered with AAA crossover ballads, the dance-heavy Witness feels like a slide backwards into adolescence, even if the album is filled with songs where Perry attempts to address big cultural issues while walking a musical cutting edge. These conflicting desires surface on a tune as effervescent as ""Chained to the Rhythm"" -- the only track here that could be called that, although ""Pendulum"" comes close -- and a song as somnolent as ""Bigger Than Me,"" the second of two ballads on the record and the one that addresses the fallout of the 2016 presidential election. Despite some sociological broad strokes, Perry generally keeps her focus personal -- and usually romantic, although ""Swish Swish"" plays like a swipe at another superstar -- a decision that, when married to aggressive EDM-pop, erodes whatever adult contemporary progress Perry made with Prism. So, Witness is a conceptual muddle but that incoherence could've been excused if there were hooks in either its grooves or melodies. Instead, Witness is populated with busy, tuneless tracks that seemed designed to pulsate in the background of a regrettable night. Perry's insistence on delving deep into electronic dance doesn't play like a pop visionary charting new directions forward; it seems anxious, as if she can sense her youth -- and perhaps more importantly, her stardom among youth -- slipping away."
pos,"I was just surprised the score is low. When I first listened to this album, I thought Coldplay make a difference from previous albums. Somehow different, but I think it's like U2's ""Pop"" album. If they try to be better, they can make the same level as ""Achtung Baby""."
pos,"I think its amazing how sure of them selves people can be when it comes to music. To review an album takes time, and you have to be objective. I dont see a lot of reviews that has that in mind. They know, they know and this is how it is. If u think other wise you are an idiot, it seems. Well, I have spent time on this album, u can trust me on that. I don know if i am right but here it is:
Mylo xyloto, compared to coldplay and their earlier work is a 5. Mylo Xyloto compared too all the other music out there is a sure ten. There u have it:) Respect!"
pos,"At first, I really didn't care much for it but after sitting down again and giving it a hard listen, I actually quite like. Most of the songs on it are rather good and enjoyable. My only complaint is that some of the tracks on it sound a bit too similar to each other. Other than that, It's better than Viva La Vida in my opinion. I like it and would definitely recommend."
pos,"Coldplay's 5th album: Mylo Xyloto is a smooth addition to their smooth transition of sound. As Viva la Vida did, it continues to make their earlier work sound more distant than ever. The first four tracks (excluding the title tracks) are all career highlights. I am astounded by the anthemic energy that these songs unleash. And they become more clear with every listen. This first third of the album makes me think of shooting stars and fireworks. Music like this has no other place but above the sky and into the heavens. Hurts like Heaven's guiar riffs are like a meteor shower. Paradise has well-sinked and beautiful piano in the first half, a blasting chorus that enters late in the song, it's rewarding every listen. Charlie Brown proves the album's similarity to Viva la Vida. The lyrics and sound of the track make me just want to run around in the city streets like a happy teenager. After this loud, euphoric entrance, the album descends into the quiet ""Us Against the World"" The song is beautiful with an anti-climactic buildup with piano and strong bass. While the lyrics are among their weakest, and perhaps the weakest on the album, it is a fine song, and defines the upcoming moodiness in sound of the album, as next we are brought into ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"", a song that knocks you off your feet at the end with climactic drums just as you thought that the song couldn't get anymore immense. Major Minus is a multi-accustic attack with Martins lyrics and vocals at the finest. Once his snarling falsetto comes in near the end, I can't help but think of Radiohead. UFO comes in with the next mood swing. It is the ""Faust Arp"" of Coldplay. Mesmerizing strings and base. Martin's lyrics are all but authentic, but they work and the song is beautiful nonetheless. Princess of China throws me off, I can't tell why Coldplay wanted her in as a duet, nonetheless, the beat and catchy simple piano carries you through along with the beautiful strings in the background. ""Up in Flames"" is a perfect ballad for heartbroken men and women. The aching piano, bass beat, and martin's sensational falsetto make the song. Then we're brought into ""Don't Let it Break Your Heart"", it is their loudest and most atmospheric song to date. Just as you thought that the loud optimism earlier in the album was gone, you are bombarded by this. The meteor shower is back with hasty riffs and atmospheric echoes of Martin's voice. The last track is so beautiful, it may be the best on the album. ""Up with the Birds"" is a perfect ending to the album. It's optimistic yet quiet climax brings you back down to earth, and changes whole perspective of the album. Coldplay Have been smoothly changing their sound throughout the years. I see X & Y as the perfect middle between this album and Parachutes. The sheer optimism and heavenly noise of this near masterpiece makes me wonder what they will do with their next release - if they have one."
pos,"Mylo Xyloto is definitely not Coldplay's best album; but it certainly isn't as mediocre or bad as many make it out to be. The electronic flourishes that are so eminent complement the sound well and all in all the album sounds refreshing and different from their previous work. Personal favourites from this album are 'Major Minus' and 'Don't Let It Break Your Heart'. However I do admit that a couple songs such as 'Princess of China' stray away a bit too far and while they are good songs, feel out of place. Songwriting in a few could be better as well."
pos,"People can think that MX is much worse than the others album. And maybe they're right. But this doesn't mean it's a bad album. Even if it's the worse of Coldplay's albums it's an excellent album.
It's an explosion of colours and positivity that hit you. Hurts Like Heaven and Charlie Brown, Paradise, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, Princess of China, Up in Flames and UFO... this album has got something for everyone."
pos," don't know why people are disappointed from this album, i think it's pretty good, paradise, every teardrop is a waterfall, charlie brown, up with birds, don't let it break your heart, this is the coldplay that i love, i mean i loved the previous albums a lot but you have to progress at some point and change a little bit, you can't satisfy your fans by making the same songs all over again! it's not a bad album i mean come on! "
pos,Maybe not quite as good as Rush of Blood or Viva La Vida but it is indeed another great Coldplay album. All the songs are worth listening to. Nice job Coldplay!
pos,"What's in the critic minds? The album is focused, in great and enjoying songs, Coldplay it's bringing a brand new style, based on the old style of the band, but converted to this epoch."
pos,What a treat to listen to such amazing vocals and a fanatic spread of songs to enjoy listening to. I can't really say enough about the way Chris Martin and the rest of Coldplay appeals to me. Don't. Beak your heart and Hurts like Heaven are two amazing songs.
pos,"I love this album. It just shows that Coldplay are willing to expand their horizons, with a new pop-influenced, electronic sound. I don't know why there's so much hate for ""Charlie Brown"" I think it's a fantastic song. Other notable songs are 'Hurts Like Heaven', 'Every Teardrop', 'Us Against the World', 'U.F.O', 'Paradise', 'Don't Let It Break Your Heart', 'Up With the Birds'. 
Personally, I'm not a big fan of 'Princess of China', but I do give credit to Coldplay because they're trying new things. And that really paid off."
neg,"Most of the songs in this album are total trash with no sense of rhythm, definitely not music you can dance to. The only one worth listening to is the collab with Nicki, and that's because the beat is awesome and she slays her part. Very disappointed by her new music, hope she gets back to making good pop hits"
neg,"Her worst album. Katy Perry lost her soul in this work, i can't feel her. Prsim was even more mature. I don't think if she's going to sell again like she did before."
neg,"I'm shocked that people are giving this heap of steaming dog crap 10 star reviews. I suspect that most of them are teenage Katy Perry stalker fans because this album is embarrassingly bad, especially after the way it was hyped up. I'm still confused as to why any artist would make a grandiose announcement claiming that they will be releasing purposeful music, and then come out with a song like ""Bon Appetit"". Seriously? I can't even listen to the whole song because my head hurts from face-palming so much. Personally, I barely made it through this album. I found the songs to be, for the most part, boring, and the lyrics nothing short of cringe-worthy. I honestly feel like a middle school student could write better lyrics, and that's just sad knowing that there was an entire team of people working on this album. I think there was 1 song that didn't make me want to jump out of a window: Into Me You See. The rest seems over-produced and I agree with other reviewers who said it doesn't seem like Katy believes the words she is singing. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this album, as there are other artists making much better music right now. This fell very short for me."
neg,"i really dont like this album, is so very bad The rhythms are horrible, is it better Teenage Dream than this shit, is better all that this reaaaaaally"
neg,"This is Katy's worst album to date. Every song sounds the same, and the production is lifeless. There isn't one song that can be a single, and she isn't challenging herself yet again. It's just the same old same old mediocre Katy."
neg,"Total trash,Katy Perry is flop now.All I can say is very disappointed.These songs are horrible,and she should stop talking about her feud with taylor swift,people are very tired now,continue selling your shoes katy."
neg,"It's definitely her weakest album. Its a compilation of forgettable and overproduced songs. It's not even cohesive. I didn't even hear or feel the ""purposeful pop"". Mind Maze was the most disappointing, like really?! Auto-tune?"
neg,"Overall this album is lackluster. It's definitely pop, but her attempt to make it purposeful falls short. Due to the entirety of the album suffering from underwhelming writing I can't find a pulse. Although, the production for her lead single ""Chained to the Rhythm"" strikes a groove for a split second but dissipates as her guest drudges through. Other than that, the rest of the tracks are quite unpleasant and unambitious. It needs some of her old flair from the previous albums, or at least a concept that will work in her favor. In a sentence, this album is too dense and dreary to accomplish what should be the best pop album this year."
neg,"In her weakest album,Katy shows that being an empty hit maker for years won't help you when you want to show a little more substance.Supported by three forgettable singles,the album fails to show a more mature and conscious Katy,while trying to keep her roots in pop bangers."
neg,"This album is such a disappointment... Songs aren't as catchy as they could be, some are in all honesty barely listenable. As for the lyrics, it's a mixed feeling from me. Katy Perry has certainly done better and this album will not go down as her masterpiece."
neg,"Oh Katy, basic lyrics, basic sounds, really did you prepared this for 4 years? The worst album of the year, bad singles, and you deserve the yellow critique."
pos,"Despite the inequal love distribution between the songs, the top tracks are simply amazing in the album. It will capture hearts for sure, as Coldplay delivers yet a different experience of songs that will uplift you and make you feel motivated from it's ensorcelling melodies."
pos,Coldplay's best album by far and my favorite album in the world. Every song is class; the band has really pulled it out of the bag with enchanting and uplifting lyrics and melodies.
pos,"Sure it's not as good as any of the other Coldplay albums, but I owe this album one. I think this is probably what got me into Coldplay. I enjoyed many different songs, however I do think that there were a few songs that were kind of made me go ""meh."" My favorite songs were probably ""Hurts Like Heaven"", ""Paradise"" and ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall."""
pos,"This album sets its style right from the start with the intensely upbeat Hurts Like Heaven, and sticks with it down the stretch, providing several catchy and emotionally powerful tunes. It's a respectable album overall and it's a good addition to the Coldplay discography."
pos,"This album is nothing but amazing, every song is so energetic and makes you feel like you're infinite, like you could do anything. I know they're not perfect, their lyrics are not the best but what you feel when you're listening to Coldplay is unique. I love how their songs are all connected, how each song finishes and the next one is right there using the last notes of the previous song to start. That's great because that's how I think every album should be, it's not just a bunch of random songs, it's about related songs that contain a message and a purpose and that's exactly what Mylo Xyloto is. We're so lucky to have enjoyed such evolution from one of the greatest bands of the moment. "
pos,"Long before I heard this album in its entirety, I heard the song ""Paradise"", which was inescapable back in 2012, and after its time in the limelight was over Coldplay once again fell out of my realm of musical knowledge for a while until I again happened upon the song a few years later when my iPhone was set on shuffle. Having heard a few of their songs other than that one (most notably the 2009 Song of the Year Grammy winner ""Viva la Vida""), I became curious and researched the album, which led me to listening to it, then downloading it, then listening to more Coldplay, and finally to downloading more Coldplay. 

The change in sound they demonstrate, even just since ""Death and All His Friends"" (I label it as such to avoid confusion between album and song, and that album was itself a large break from their previous style), is incredible. Their songwriting method isn't such a huge break from tradition, but there is a world of difference between the sonic details of this effort and past ones: the sparse, U2-reminiscent guitar bits and focus on instrumentation are still in play all over the album, but their foray into electronic really set the bar for their next several works. It showcases (or it did, rather, as they seem to have been stuck in an electropop rut ever since) a willingness to change and experiment, something that is necessary for a band's continued survival and creative relevancy, but they don't seem yet fully vested in the idea. Chris Martin explained after the release of this album that it originated as two, one boasting an electronic sound and the other an acoustic one, that they ended up combining. The more traditional acoustic songs seem to be there as something to fall back on in case their experiment isn't as successful as they want it to be, which takes away from the grandeur of the electronic bits because of their attempt to play it safe and the acoustic bits because they aren't satisfied with being stuck as just another group of British alt-rockers. 

Another element of this album that I feel works a bit against it is its classification as a concept album/rock opera. I have nothing against the story or concept themselves, which are honestly among the best I've ever seen in their respective categories--the story of a distant alien planet where an oppressive government has banned color and music and are resisted by freedom fighters who can generate graffiti-like ""sparks"" sounds like the premise of some sci-fi movie. Yet rather than focus on the societal messages such an idea would generate--say, freedom of expression and when this becomes dangerous--the group settles instead for what many in the sci-fi film business often do as well: a love story. This isn't as noticeable until towards the end, but it definitely harms the concept enough to be noticeable in the grand scheme of things. 

With that said, there is plenty to enjoy on this album as well. The little sonic details worked into more traditional electronic music are present here as well and aid in crafting a more enjoyable listening experience. The whole record is chock full of cresting waves of emotion, from rousing and grandiose anthems (the aforementioned ""Paradise"", ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"", and the divisive ""Princess of China"") as well as more subdued tracks (""Us Against the World"", ""Up in Flames""), and even a few things we either haven't seen from them yet or have caught only glimpses of (the delightfully dark and playful ""Major Minus"", one of their songs most thoroughly ""rock"" in genre, is one that comes to mind). The amount of thought that went into this album is clearly evident, this is the most audaciously creative the band has been to date. Their first few records, while undoubtedly among their best (especially ""A Rush of Blood to the Head""), were amalgamations of influences rather than original sound: on those albums one could really hear the U2 style. However, on this record they finally come into their own with a sci-fi concept that puts most being developed by Hollywood to shame. On this album they come to conquer, and conquer they do with a wonderful (if uneven) fusion of alternative rock and soft-on-the-ears electropop. 

This album won't be remembered as one of the greats twenty to fifty years down the road, and it probably won't even be considered among the band's best offerings. However, it works while one is listening, and can be quite an addictive experience for fans who have come to know what to expect from Chris Martin and Friends. This probably isn't the best introduction album for someone new to the band, but longtime fans should be pleased, and this essentially what this album was: a record for themselves and for their fans. 7/10 "
pos,"Coldplay's 'Mylo Xyloto' is one of my guilty-pleasure pop albums, a work that is popular to dislike and discredit but, reluctantly, winds up being extremely enjoyable. While it is one of the bands most commercial records, and is a sign of what was to follow, it provides a near-enough balance of rock and pop that makes it easily accessible but worth repeated listens. It doesn't hold the artistic merit of Coldplay's earliest works, particularly 'A Rush of Blood to the Head', and it's easy to see why more refined music-goers dismiss this as a radio-friendly forty minutes of bubblegum sound, but its themes and concepts are easy to get behind. 

Supposedly set in a dystopian future, Chris Martin assigns himself as a 'freedom-fighter' type, offering up moments of hope and clarity ""underneath the rubble"" of a society that has crumbled. It's simple enough and nothing particularly new or unexplored, but it provides some clean and vibrant backdrop to songs such as 'Paradise', 'Every Teardrop is a Waterfall' and 'Don't Let it Break Your Heart'. The aim here is explosive, stadium anthems, and this is largely achieved through the strings and vocals as the band sing of colour and adventure. It's obvious why the LP was such a hit in 2010 with its easy melodies and loose lyrics, but its gloss is too enjoyable to overly critique. 

This is, personally, the last Coldplay record I really enjoyed. After 'Mylo Xyloto', Coldplay's sound followed too much of the commercial trend - 'A Sky Full of Stars' being the standout example - that became boring quickly. Aside from some off moments such as 'Princess Of China', this album is a sophisticated chart-topper that is still worth a listen if you're into easy rock-pop listens. Don't expect to be blown away by emotional moment and you'll find much to come back to here."
pos,"Not as much Coldplay as we were all used too and they changed up their style to become more of a pop band, but the album was still enjoyable for the most part. Some of the biggest difference, for me, was that lyrics seemed to have changed to be less meaningful on this album in comparison to others."
pos,"Coldplay delivers on a pop sound that they steered themselves in after the brilliant success that was Viva la Vida in 2008. Mylo Xyloto, on the other hand, delivers on a background love story that adds to the lyrical depth in many of their songs. 'Up With the Birds' was the perfect way to end the record, and it makes up for some of the duller moments in the record such as that in 'Up In Flames'. MX will forever be Coldplay's funnest album. "

pos,"In some ways, this album is pretty empty. Some of the songs lacks emotion and soreness (Princess of China) we are used to when listening to Coldplay. Some songs (Hurts Like Heaven, Don't let it break your heart) even hardly makes any sense, and that's very unusual. 

Still, this is a good to great album. The album contains a lovely theme, and a lot of dreamy songs with high quality. 'Paradise' is, for sure, a song for the masses ñ a ""track for the charts"". Still it's one of Coldplay's most beautiful songs. 

Best songs: Paradise, Major Minus, Every teardrop is a waterfall "
pos,"This album have one objection - ""Paradise"" wasn't first single from the album. Other from that, album is synonym for perfect pop/rock combination. Collaboration with Rihanna is a real deal."
pos,"As a Coldplay an myself I've got to say that this isn't their best album but still is a good compilation of songs you should listen to. First of all the inspiration of this album is from the fact that Chris Martin recently separated from Gwyneth Palthrow, making Chris Martin write songs that give feelings like sadness, reassurance and hope. But overall the album is generally an experimental because the album's genre isn't your typical alternative rock but rather an Electronica Pop if I were to say. Making this album in Electronica gives Chris Martin the opportunity to sing in an atmospheric and dynamic manner, given the song ""Midnight"" in this album which is both melodious and catchy. So bottom line for this review this album is worth listening too over and over again especially for those of you experiencing relationship issues, Coldplay is the band that will reassure you."
pos,"Ghost Stories is an interesting album. Overall, it flows beautifully from beginning to end. But take one of the songs by itself, and it's not particularly amazing. The general mood and ambience is addictive, though, and it's a welcome change from the fast-paced pop rock of Mylo Xyloto."
pos,"Coldplay fan from the beginning here. Parachutes and AROBTTH have been their masterpieces prior. The others albums have seen my enthusiasm for them wane lower and then slowly rise again. X&Y has grown on me over the years, but I consider it their weakest of their catalogue. Viva and Mylo saw them explore bigger, more bombastic sounds in a hit and miss fashion for me (mostly hit, but none rose to their first two). After viewing Chris' incredible interview with Zane Lowe about this album and hearing the singles my enthusiasm began to peak again like in the beginning era. I am pleased to say that personally this album is a success for me. I haven't wanted to hit Play immediately after the album is over so much since the first two albums. This album successfully marries the lower key, nocturnal tone of Parachutes with excellent pop sensibilities. Personally, I believe they still have three powerful singles left on this album. Ink, True Love, and Another's Arms are radio-ready and fantastic! True Love is currently my favorite tune. These tunes aren't just weepy tunes about love lost. They offer hopeful and uplifting perspectives as they explore romantic themes and sexy, sleek pop landscapes. The negativity is baffling me, but at the same time it isn't. I am discovering there seem to be more fans of their first two falling in love with this one than fans who came on board with the later albums. I believe the more commercial pop lovers would find this one accessible though so the tepid reception is a bit baffling. It is a winner for me and I am already feeling the impulse to play it again."
pos,"Man, these first two singles were great, I personally liked more Magic than the A Sky full Of Stars, but the first single was enough to encourage me. Congrats Coldplay, you guys are doing a really good job."
pos,"Best album from Coldplay in my opinion.They are always changing for good.This time Coldplay even more quite. Oceans and O(Fly On) are pure masterpiece songs like a old Coldplay.Personally, my best song is Midnight.A Sky Full of Stars makes me happy.Ink is my soul. Another's Arms another best song from Ghost Stories. Always in My Head and True Love are one of their best songs."
pos,This album is quieter and more reserved than previous Coldplay albums (notably Viva La Vida and Mylo Xyloto) which isn't a bad thing. It definitely has a few average songs but overall it is a well put together layered album.
pos,"Such a heartwrenching album... All of the songs here are flat-out amazing (except for A Sky Full of Stars which is fine). I don't get the hate this album has been getting, since this album is great!"
pos,"Sentimental and thought-provoking. Coldplay redefined soft-rock by replacing his tracks with a slow paced melody ( Magic, Midnight, A sky full of stars ) They did it again and hit me so hard !"

neg,"For little kids he might be good but in my opinion he cannot be considered a true musician, his lyrics are infantile and his music on its whole is to commercial. His voice although is not a bad one he has chosen a bad style and should rethink his career if he wants to be taken account of by people who are actually allowed to drink and not only little girls screaming for his babies."
neg,"Musically it is a disgrace to the music, is not even slag. 
I can not believe I have to admit that's a fucking commercially successful, having so much damn talent, success had to give that poor guy. I have not heard such silly songs like Baby Baby Baby Ohhh, that is, what's that?, Is this excited?, I've never heard a sound so gay in the music and rhythm alike, too gay, it's amazing that the music video that song have more views on youtube than true legends as: Smell Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana, Chop suey by System Of A Down, whole videography of Daft Punk, among others, and this has to be the most-watched, that if is a great misfortune, thank god has many dislikes. 
Just say that this album is a dirty, I'm not against Justin and even they do not believe,he can achieve to be great once you leave aside the thematic he uses in his songs, but as it is musical crap I hope that girls are cured of this bad music and hear something more convincing. "
neg,"GO AWAY justin beiber! stop! your music is a happy tragedy, thanks to you people on twitter can mock your album and thank god people wanna rip off their ear drums when listen to shit"
pos,"Certainly a very different direction; this album won't be packed full of enough hits for some, but this is an album Chris must of really needed to get out of his system. Personally I think it's beautiful, but this album will keep garnering mixed reviews."
pos,"Like many other well known, long-standing artists, Coldplay took a critics risk with Ghost Story. The rating of the album varies from critic to critic, but to true fans, the songs resonate to the soul. I find myself humming a different tune from the disc all day long. Ghost Stories did not disappoint. Coldplay can't remake ""A Rush of Blood...."" or ""X&Y"" as many would wish. Instead, they have progress far beyond those albums with their latest two...in my opinion."
pos,"I don't understand how people can be so cynical about this beautiful album. This is a breakup album and if you do not listen to this with that in mind then you really should reconsider your opinion about this album. There are so many emotions that come from this album and honestly, I can say that this is my favorite Coldplay album, as an album itself. None of these songs are necessarily my favorite Coldplay songs (except maybe Midnight) and there really is not a completely memorable song on here compared to past albums, but in my opinion the album as a whole is such an amazing piece of art that it far surpasses every Coldplay album. Each song is perfectly placed and they compliment each other. The stories told and the messages spread throughout this album really hit the heart and it's nice to listen to, especially if you realize that this is a concept album. I think everyone is giving this low reviews because some simply troll the internet with Coldplay Hate, and others are not listening to this album with the right mindset ."
pos,"This album is good. Certainly better than most the drivel out there. It almost sounds like a Chris Martin solo album and is more down tempo/depressing than their previous records outside of ""Parachutes"". The lyrics here are some of their strongest since ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". True--that's not saying much--but an improvement nonetheless. But the album is far from a classic because the melodies(Coldplay's strength) don't reach the heights of previous Coldplay albums(think Viva la Vida, Yellow, the Scientist), and ""A Sky Full of Stars"" messes up the rhythm of the album. Good effort, at least. "
neg,"People who gave it an 8 or higher. I rate based on the music i hear, I don't care what his age is, this is a kid who has little talent. His constant moaning of ohhhhh after every word is quite annoying. terribly composed even with the glassed over studio vocals."
neg,"Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE CRAP!!!!!!!! Sorry excuse for music!!!!!"
neg,Of course i didnt listen to the shit...and im proud....because seeing his annoying face on tv screen is **** enough...! some say that he is the new M.J...Really...are you **** kidding me? yeah he can be compared with MJs shoes....!
neg,"Just Awful. Kid can't sing. And the songs are soooooo boring. Makes me hunger for the Backstreet Boys (and they were horrible, but at least the songs were catchy and they could sing)."
neg,This album has got to be the worst that I have heard its just as bad as lil waynes rebirth complete trash.
neg,"In response to Shirliah W: I am a 17 year old, and the music I make is far superior to this. Justin Bieber's CD is a terrible record. It gives 16 year-old musicians a bad name."
neg,"Another example of mainstream America throwing up another worthless, talentless pop-star. And he sounds like a 10-year-old girl."
neg,"If this is what modern music is, then our generation really sucks."
neg,"Tsk tsk... Justin Bieber is an overhyped 16 year old who didn't hit puberty, and I seriously thought he was a girl when I heard ""One Time"". And singing about love? Like what do you know, you are like 16 and your voice didn't even break yet; the only people whom this album will ever appeal to is to young girls who don't know any better. ""Baby"" at first was on the verge of acceptable to my ears but his voice ruined it. Bottom line, don't buy this album."
neg,"Justin bieber and other singers that sing like him are ruining music. All his songs are about how he wants a girl. I doubt he even writes the lyrics. I am going to have to agree with Andrew, green day is great music that is suitable for teenagers and has great lyrics that people can relate to. I also doubt justin bieber will be popular in 10 years anyway."
neg,"This is shit thrown on to a compact disc, what the hell happened to actually working your ass off to get your album on the radio and making money for your family or yourself. its like he cant write his own lyrics, cant come up with a beat by himself. This kid should get raped by a silver back gorilla. This album is the reason i hate pop. The only semi good song on this is Baby and even that is so repetitive it starts to get annoying by the middle of the song. I HATE this kid and album with a PASSION. this piece of shit gets a 0 out of 10"
neg,"It's pretty much an offense for me that music has downgraded so much. Listening to such an horrible album with an iPod is like walking around with an insult.
Let's get over it, and analyze it.
So, he claims to be a singer, but it sounds like a cat squeaking randomly, singing lyrics about love 'n' babies 'n' girls 'n' stuff. Such a lack of fantasy. And, considering all the success he made, in so few time, vanishes completely all the hard work of less known bands like Pink Floyd. Yes, Justin Bieber made more success than Pink Floyd, and i hardly can accept this. If he started working like twenty years ago he would possibly sound better. Older music has better style, i say, and he is pretty much the obvious proof. I believe that if he made a black metal band, i would've liked his music more, and that means a lot since i completely disapprove black metal for its lyrics about death, and stuff. I still prefer to listen to that to be forced to listen to hundred of people whistling Bieber's song ""Baby"" while listening to the song itself. If Pink Floyd had the same success as him, Roger Waters would now have over a hundred of billion of people following him up. Such a number that i hope will never turn to truth, but i think that teenagers of today will make many sons tomorrow to have them listen to Justin Bieber, and he will become the richest & most famous person ever existed, and if that will happen, i'll already have a knife slashed inside my stomach. But that will not happen: he will get blind by how famous he already is, and will be forgotten in a few years on for now"
neg,This album is... nothing. Unoriginal and not worth being called music. Just another money-making bullshit and the victims are poor 12-year-old girls.
neg,"It is so depressive to see how quality in music has been downgraded so much in the recent years, in this album, songs have repetitive lyrics, stupid choruses and senseless meaning of lyrics. Even seeing the album cover makes one feel bad."
neg,Probably the worst ive ever heard. This kid has to stop making music.
neg,Truly i listened to this whole album...waste of 60 minutes it is. My world 2.0 is terrible. my dog barked to the songs along with my cat who was meowing. They seem to know what terrible music is so they screeched along with justin beaver.
pos,"Everyone giving this CD twos and zeros must not be true Coldplay fans. This may not be their best album, but to me its a perfect chill album that I will enjoy for months to come. Worth a listen for sure, just don't expect any huge hits. Enjoy!!"
pos,"For some, this album is great. For others, not so much. But despite the controversy, I'd like to take it as it is... a ghost story. The overall sound is refreshing, somber and reflective of past experiences of love, which is different. Although it still provides some of the sounds from previous albums, for example, Oceans would have fitted in well with Parachutes. It is safe, calm and collected, it does not have such an adventurous tone. But, on the other hand, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall, it provides familiarity, as well as some new elements to produce an atmosphere of the past, love and separation. "
pos,"Although people who aren't already Coldplay fans will for the most part be unimpressed and slightly bored by this album, those who are already steady listeners will love the smooth and emotional songs that have a nice mix of older Coldplay styles and steady electronic background music"
pos,"This is probably Coldplay's 2nd best album since ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". Honestly, I was expecting something more acoustic, but when ""A Sky Full of Stars"" came out I knew this album will be like a remastered version. Coldplay's biggest essence is the sappy lyrics, and this album is not the exception. Better than Mylo Xyloto. But, spoiler, if you're expecting something like Mylo Xyloto, this is the wrong album. Is more like their first four albums together in one."
pos,"I believe that, when their career eventually comes to a close...Coldplay will have an album to go with any time of day or year...and any type of emotion you may be feeling at the time. This is their night album, or their rainy day album. No, these songs don't reach the crescendos of Viva La Vida, or go as off the wall as MX. This album would have been more of a proper follow up to A Rush of Blood to the Head. However, you can see from their work with Eno, and through honing their craft through the previous two albums, they have really created a beautiful piece of art here...and what is arguably their most listenable album to date. 

Criticism seems to go two ways...either this wasn't heartfelt and sappy enough...or it was too heartfelt and sappy. To address the former...Chris Martin, despite the somber nature of his earlier work...has developed into a wide-eyed optimist of sorts. What is most moving about this album, in my opinion, is that you hear side of him break apart; you hear him teeter on the edge of losing his faith in the world. Nowhere is this more apparent than 'Oceans' and 'O'. 'Oceans' shows him looking over the edge, thinking about jumping. In 'O' he decides to step back...but not before letting out a chilling, emotional wail (OOOH...the title of the song after all). In that wail, you can hear his heart break. Moving stuff. 

For those hoping for another Viva or MX...this is not that...but that's okay. For those who, like myself, fell in love with Coldplay the first time you heard 'Clocks' or 'See You Soon', this album is refreshing, and very enjoyable. 

Of course the lyrics leave something to be desired...but really I think Chris Martin has come to terms with this and isn't really trying to improve that anymore. He, and Coldplay as a whole, know what they are. They are a universally loved, but also often mocked band that will never be a favorite of the critics; but it seems to me they've gotten past that. They know what music they want to make, and in this case, I believe they have made a solid, moving, well written album that will only get better with age. 

And, thankfully, Rihanna doesn't make an appearance this time."
pos,"Say what you will about Coldplay, but it cannot be denied that Chris Martin is an extraordinary melodist, or that the band knows how to elevate his melodies to epic heights. Personally, I fell in love with them the very moment I first heard ""Clocks"". ROBTTH and Viva la Vida are among my favorite albums of all time, and I have thoroughly enjoyed X&Y and Parachutes. Mylo Xyloto almost lost me, but eventually I found a certain enjoyment in it, although I still consider it to be their weakest effort. With their 6th LP, the band delivers 12 solid tunes (including the bonus tracks), each of which are clearly above average, melodically speaking. The instrumental supplementation is decidedly subdued and electronic this time around, leading to a crisply produced and spaciously atmospheric sonic landscape. It may not be particularly innovative or high energy, but few can deny that the sounds and melodies here have a certain beauty to them. They never quite reach the ecstatic heights of ""Clocks"", ""Speed Of Sound"", or ""Paradise"", but they manage to hit some pretty stunning melodic turns (especially during the second halves of each tune). These melodies take time to evolve and set in, and I found myself enjoying them more and more as I re-listened. Ultimately, it is Chris Martin, and his melodies prove to be a cut above most other musicians, at least in terms of consistency. His lyrics, however, suffer greatly from time to time on this LP. While there are some heart-turning moments, there are also some gut-turning ones. For instance, ""Got a tattoo that said 2gether thru life"" is perhaps one of the most cringe-worthy things Chris has ever written. Emotionally, some of these songs can hit pretty hard, while just a few I found lacking. This said, I haven't found it as emotionally compelling as ROBTTH or Viva la Vida, but considering the emotional weight of those albums, that isn't saying much. If Coldplay does it for you, this one is sure to move you in one way or another. So, to suffice, this album is a more subdued, electronic, and atmospheric Coldplay. It's full of lush melodies and emotional resonance, but it also lacks the energy and some of the meaningful lyrics of their previous work. Ultimately, if you enjoy Coldplay's melodies, you are sure to find something here."
neg,if I could give this a negative rating I would he sounds like a 8 year old girl whos trying to be cool but he fails.
neg,"Please, make it stop. Horrible. Generic. Only for those who have no taste which, sadly, is almost all of America. Enjoy being a fad, sweetheart, your time's almost up."
neg,"What a disappointing PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!! Bieber sucks and he always will. Don't listen to beliebers... at least try not to. They are low or none educated. The wourst song is baby. Double da**it to hell and back in a cheese basket. Please avoid both this album and the moronic wanker himself, AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!! He SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
neg,"Generic, bland, tween-pop sensationalism. His music is a passing fad that is akin to passing gas."
neg,The worst thing to happen to music.
neg,"Justin Bieber should really focus on other topics.Getting girls is all he talks about?Why not talk about...death or something?I don't know but I'm tired of hearing him always wanting to ""get the girl"". Jeez whoever he's singing about, I would say ""NO"" too. The songs are alright, but not what I expected.Here's a Three out of pityy!"
pos,"I have been a Coldplay fan since AROBTTH, and I have to say, this album has redeemed them from Mylo. Every single song on this album flows perfectly to the next. It tells a beautiful story of love and loss. This is their best work since their bronze age of the early 2000's. I don't understand why they have been so lowly rated. It's a mx of their old and exploring some new. The Perfect mix."
pos,"I have to admire a band who goes against popular demand to produce something that hasn't been seen in almost 15 years. This album isnt quite up to scuff that Parachutes was but I've always liked the sound they had back than and I admire them for taking a brief step back into time. I think once X and Y came out, and with the exception of Viva La Vida it just went downhill from there ending with the disaster that was ""Mylo Xyloto"". There's something just Nostalgic about this album, it's a fresh breath of hope for me to see that the band has not forgotten it's roots just at the moment I thought they did."
pos,Well its all very amiable which is a bit unusual for Coldplay; its future-directed but reflective & there are nods to early musical influences; there is a pleasantly doleful undertow; its more comfortably middle of the road than in the verges; and the tone is suitably ethereal. I really liked it.
pos,"I am a greatest fan of Coldplay since Parachutes, and i think this album is so emotional, wonderful and takes you to other dimension.. i have to admit that this album is not the best, i believe that A Rush Blood To Head is their best album... But still are a Beautiful album, better than Mylo Xyloto"
pos,A highly charged album full of emotion and heartache. Ghost Stories is beautifully crafted and takes the listener on a journey from its sombre beginning to its euphoric conclusion.
neg,"Come on people, 16 year old girls should listen to blink-182 or green gay to develop a good music taste lately. THIS is hideous crap to for no one to be listened by."
neg,Not good music at all. And Shirliah W. nas was 16 when he wrote illmatic. This album is definitely not the best music a 16 year old w/ writers and producers could come up with. 
neg,Complete bubblegum garbage. Just another teen fad that's going to die as soon as it flowers. It's a sad example of the transient frivolities that are the music industry nowadays. People say there will never be another The Beatles; it's because people are too obsessed with non-music trash like this to pay attention to groups with legitimate records.
neg,"Hate this album. One of the worst ever. Wasted my money by buying this. He should stop singing and and do some other things. People who reviewed positively, you all are mentally ill so get some help. And to the fan-girls, get some help too, he's ugly and screeches instead of singing. Not recommended at all."
neg,"How Can This CD Be Anyworse... Biebers Voice Is Annoying.. So So So High... He Sounds Like A Girl.. I Am 13 & I Have A Much Lower Voice Than Him! WOW Justin The 1st Time I Heard It I Thought You Were A Girl.. Lyrics Are Stupid, As Well As The Vocal Effects.."
neg,"Absolutely not worthy of publication. This album is not music, is a ""commercial thing"" to do money. Baby could have been a good single for the beat but the word are not mature enough for a 16 years old guyÖ"
neg,"Again? This is llike the capcom games, for example, have Street Fighter, and after Super Street Fighter IV, and I never imagine that this happen in the music industry. This album have only one good song, the rest is terrible. A next CD of Bieber? No I don't believe that."
neg,"I just don't know where to start. It seems as though everything was made to be as tasteless, derivative and processed as possible. Only tweenagers who haven't yet developed a taste in good music will enjoy this trash. Simply put, it's an insult to the music industry."
neg,Sings on key most of the time. But his voice is still too high for my taste and most of the songs are extremely repetitive.
neg,"While devendra banhart's beautiful ""smokey rolls down thunder canyon"" got a metascore of 69 and bloc party's masterpiece ""a weekend in the city"" a 65, justin bieber gets a 71. this is really the proof that music critics aren't objective, but give an 80 for ""hey there are clever producers and if i think it's cool despite of it's shitty genre i'm so impartial and thus even more respectable"" and a 50 for ""gnah, this might be very good stuff but only liking the first album and discarding the follow-ups is always cool"""
neg,"The f.. what you said has no cred too, Woflmother. Let me tell you something: 1st, what a majority of people hates might not be a fad but a reality (think of any detestable things on the surface of the Earth), 2nd, so because JB's music is better than K-Fed's (which is doubtful to me) so his music's got substances ? It's like saying someone is decent because he's saner than Charles Manson. 3rd, let me tell you, any ""critics"" who say anything good about JB are either half-witted or cheaply-paid tools for the corporates themselves.
So, in short, people with taste and rationale should speak the f#ck up before our materialistic societies plunge deeper and deeper into the ugly, mass-produced, mass-deluded, dumb-downed mess it has been becoming."
neg,"Justin Bieber is for the kids. For a 13-year-old girl, Justin Bieber is someone to look up to. He's definitely talented. There's no question about it. Old videos of when he was only twelve can prove that he wasn't signed for his looks. ""My World 2.0"" is catchy, simple and effective. I'd rather have my daughter listen to this than to much of the filthy-mouthed rappers and R&B singers out there today. For young teens there has to be someone who's actually the same age, but who's talented. Justin Bieber is talented and ""My World 2.0"" is no waste of your kid's pocket money"
neg,"One of the worst things ever made. Do not listen to this. Do not think of listening to this. The sounds of torture would be preferable than this piece of shit This ""music"" is bad on too many levels to describe. Just stay away. For the sake of humanity, stay away, and make this kid stop making music."
pos,"One of the best Coldplay's album ever. I was waiting something like X&Y or A Rush of Blood to the Head, and they did a mix of both styles. All the songs are awesome!"
pos,"In all honesty to Coldplay, this is one of there more mellow albums and that is saying something when you consider the genre of songs they usually produce, however I feel Chris and the boys have not let themselves down with the making of this album, and I feel they have proved what they set out to do with this album, and that was to produce an acoustic, more strip-backed album. It takes away the 'thematics' , noise and hustle bustle of mylo xyloto, and produces a more reflective, awe-inspiring album. Critics will have their views of everything sounding the same, and may describe the songs as lack-lustre, but I feel once again Chris and the boys have produced something that is quietly brilliant."
pos,"With the exception of ""A Sky Full of Stars"", the album is much moodier and somber than Mylo Xyloto and Viva La Vida with a tone much closer to Parachutes. Of course, Chris Martin's recent breakup hovers over the album, much like The Edge's did over Achtung Baby when it came out, but these two albums are nothing alike. Actually, I think it feels a little closer to Beck's Sea Change album in feel and tone (also another breakup album). Because it's Coldplay, it will get played and played, which will annoy those who already hate them so much. 

At the moment, I'd give it a solid out of 4 stars, but over time that may change. History always treats some albums better than others."
pos,"I've never enjoyed Martin's lyrics more in my life. After just ending a five-year relationship, this is the kind of sad but optimistic music I needed. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, Martin's paints a picture of man who lost love and is ready and willing to find it again. It may seem more like the other band members aren't contributing as much but compared to previous records, there is more of an influence by each member in creating the emotion of the music. Their first single, ""Magic"", simply started life as a riff by bassist Guy Berryman. You can also hear his electronic and melancholy side-project, Apparatjik, on ""Midnight"". ""Oceans"" recalls some of their better early album b-sides, like ""Proof."" Their second single, ""Sky Full of Stars"" might be the only song is the only song I might dislike due to it feeling misplaced. But if you're the biggest pop-alternative band in the world releasing a less accessible album, then why not put an obvious pop hit to ensure money, it's a smart business move. 
Highlights on the album: 
The cool ""Ink"" that shows Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill 
""True Love"" with its amazing Jonny Buckland out-of-tune guitar solo 
The finale ""O"" with its concept of falling out of love "
pos,"another great album from coldplay,my second favorite after AROBTH,the songs magic,another arms and ghost stories are simply superb,other songs are great too...thanks Chris and coldplay for this great album."
neg,"If it wasn't for included ballads in the album, ""My World 2.0"" really would be one of the worst albums in music's history. Excessive auto-tune in pop-dancing melodies which make them strident and unpleasant. ""Baby"" is absolutely the worst song of the album. A horrible intro that gives a very little interest to continue with it."
neg,"I don't think his fans (especially the girls) don't realize the fact that he is a mediocre singer. He is not consistent with this album because of his voice. Most of his songs are horrible. Although ""U Smile"" was really good, it was overshadowed. This is probably the WORST album I have ever heard in my entire life!!! I hope Justin Bieber will improve or else, many fans will be disappointed"
neg,"The album is a total failure and the only reason why he is still in the music industries is because of his ""Girl fans."" The songs in the album is mostly boring and dull but at least is better than Rebecca Black's ""Friday"""
neg,"The chords are stolen from generations of other pop songwriters (as are some of the lyrics), the production is stolen from generations of other pop producers, the meaning and purpose of the songs is completely ripped from millions of repetitive imbeciles with only love (or sex) on their minds. And I see others on this site complaining that ""IT'S FOR TEENAGE GIRLS, WAAH"". Well get a sense of perspective; good music can appeal to anyone of any age. That's why people like the Beatles and Queen and Coldplay were so successful, they had universal appeal. Targeting one extremely easily pleased audience does not make Beiber's albums good, and he deserves to sink into obscurity - which he eventually will."
neg,"Classic example of how music is ruined nowadays.
This kid is just a cute face chosen by some crappy record label to mask a bunch of annoying and sticky songs completely autotuned."
neg,"68. Really, it seems like a joke that music critics can put this mark to this album. I have listened it all, and I can ensure yoy that it is the worst thing that I have ever listened to. Even My World, the first EP of Justin Bieber, that I would mark it with a 0, is better than this CD.
Let's be serious. Commercial music is usually crap. It is a question of its sense. And I'm not talking about this pseudo commercial music like Glam Metal, 80's pop like Michael Jackson, and nowadays Indie Rock. I'm talking about music only made for sell, without attempting to make it last over the years. And inside this bad music, My World 2.0 is really deplorable.
There are some reasons why this is so bad. First and most important, the music. Composed with no musical sense at all, the melody is so simple and pathetic that Lady Gaga seems King Crimson next to it. No rhythm, no grace, no nothing. The instruments are dreadful, playing repetitive sounds and crappy riffs, and his voice is so auto-tuned that Daft Punk voices at Discovery album seems natural. A complete disaster.
But what makes it worse than a simple painful album is its spirit. A girl-looking boy of 16 years old singing about love, dreams mad true, etc. It's obvious that it is a big and vile strategy of his record label to make it attractive for pre adolescent girls that have been brainwashed by the system and have not listened any good music at their life. And the worst thing is that music critics don't punish this CD as it deserves. What's wrong with you guys? Have you been payed by its label? But if any of its consumers would read this! What a sad world. Absolutly an awful album, the worst of all time."
pos,"Hey! What do you know! It's pretty good! Each track has interesting production, and the lyrics, however short and direct, convey their message well. Midnight, produced by IDM genius Jon Hopkins, is a captivating track with almost no drums at all, and it's probably my favorite. Another's Arms with its sighing, pitch bending synths, is a great track as well. However, some of the filler tracks such as Ink and True Love are a little bland for my taste. This album is definitely worth a listen, and while it's no masterpiece, it's interesting that Coldplay decided to the take this route for an album, and they actually pulled it off relatively well."
pos,Romantic yet heartbreaking Album....The fact that coldplay takes sharp turns in every new album by making new and different sounds is just incredible...Give it time & it will grow on you.
pos,"it is one of their best albums. You can feel everything in this album like the A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD feeling in Anothers Arms, PARACHUTES in Oceans, X&Y in Ghost Story, VIVA LA VIDA in All Your Friends and the MYLO XYLOTO in Sky Full Of Stars. this album is epic."
pos,"I have enjoyed everything that Coldplay have produced since their sparkling debut ""Parachutes"", especially ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" and ""Viva La Vida or Death and all his friends"" and while ""X and Y"" and ""Mylo Xyloto"" were in need of some serious trimming down, they are still both full of excellent pop songwriting and are well put together albums. With ""Ghost Stories"", the band take a slight turn off their usual stadium pop rock route. While you couldn't say that ""Ghost Stories"" is a stripped down album, it certainly has a more delicate feel when compared to almost every album since their debut ""Parachutes"". As most people are aware, the album was fueled by the break up of lead man Chris Martin's marriage and while it doesn't quite rank among the greatest of the break up album, the lyrics and themes give an insight into the denial of and struggle against ""uncoupling"" process. Opener ""Always In My Head"" is reminiscent of ""Strawberry Swing"" but at a slower tempo. Its a downbeat track which cries out to be played at a quicker pace, however it sets the tone for the album. ""Magic"", one of the main singles from the album is a perfect piece of pop built around a simple, swerving bass line. ""Ink"" and ""True Love"" are standard Coldplay numbers, packing an effortless pop-rock punch. ""Midnight"" is one of the more curious tracks on the records with the Martin's vocals going all Bon Iver on us. ""Anothers Arms"" perfectly puts across the distress of thinking of your beloved with another before we get to the ""Oceans"", a track which could have been lifted straight off of their previously mentioned debut ""Parachutes"". This is followed by the anthemic but over produced and oddly out of place ""A Sky Full of Stars"". ""O"" brings things to a gentle and downbeat end. Another solid effort from the band, and a record that holds its own in a back catalog of colossal albums. "
neg,"To anyone who actually likes this music, or Justin Bieber for that mater, you have a lower IQ than my friends dog. The biggest load of abominable garbage to ever walk the earth"
neg,Real score: -100/10 This is the worst album ever created. Along with the rest of justin biebers horrendous music. Please never make me listen to this ever again.
neg,"When I was seven, I had a Britney Spears poster on my wall, and choreographed dances to ""Lucky"" with my friends at sleepovers. If I was seven now, I would probably have the same love for Justin Bieber. However, I'm not seven, and I'm doubtful if many people much older than that would actually enjoy this album. I actually listened to My World 2.0 all the way through, and can say that it's not the creation from hell that many make it out to be. It's certainly not a great work of artistry either. I will actually admit to liking ""Somebody To Love"", and ""Stuck In The Moment"" temporarily got stuck in my head. But it's a weak album, with wholly uninspiring lyrics and bland uninteresting music. And, of course, it's sung by a prepubescent boy. I like lots of music, including pop music. This is not quality pop music"
neg,"Slickly produced, but overtly cheesy, vocals are too processed and the whole album is scant of originality. I'm not giving this album a bad review just to ride the hate of Justin Bieber, but because it is truly BAD."
neg,The first My World album was bad enough he didn't have to release a 2.0 over to make us feel worse about ourselves. I did see one review stating that they wished there was a score below zero I would have to agree.
neg,"Flat voice , annoying sound, we can consider that the only thing helpful in this album is some compositions , boring teen pop , childish, and immature , expected more from you Bieber , nothing new about the sun , always the bubblegum pop to fasten the little girls teenagers, we still have a Purpose , and a Believe to save the right discography"
neg,"While this album is bad, it isn't as bad as most people think, and it's only judged because of ""Baby"" (the worst song off the album), however some songs such as ""Somebody to Love"" are tolerable."
neg,what a terrible album. Even worst then My World. I really wish he've never done that.
pos,"Firstly - I genuinely don't get how people can give this either 10/10 or 0/10. I suspect (with some exceptions, of course) that the zero end of things would like to punch Chris Martin in the face and think all Coldplay fans are weaklings with no taste in music. Frankly, they can bugger off. 

As for the album itself - there's more good than bad and it's a definite grower. Whilst the lyrics are, even by CM's standards, very heart-on-sleeve, the band's ear for a melody is still phenomenal. ""Magic"" is pretty much two chords (plus two transitional chords) throughout but sounds so much warmer. ""Midnight"" is a beautiful piece of soft electronica, whilst ""Oceans"" would sit very nicely as a second part to Parachutes' ""We Never Change"". Indeed, the pared-back nature of the album harks back to that first album, save for the synth flourishes that have grown from X&Y through to Mylo Xyloto. ""O"" sounds like an extended version of the gorgeous piano introduction to ""Atlas"" whilst ""Ink"" has a simple guitar phrase similar to ""Strawberry Swing"". 

On the down side: ""A Sky Full Of Stars"" is almost more of an Avicii song than a Coldplay one and ""True Love"" is utterly forgettable, save for the tender plea ""tell me you love me, if you don't then lie"". The one minute plus of ambient noise following both ""Oceans"" and ""O"" are also completely unnecessary. 

All in all a pleasant if slow album, a gentle reminder of the intimacy that Coldplay are so effortlessly capable of. It will be interesting how it converts to live shows, particularly if they go the stadium/arena route. In the meantime I'd recommend giving this album a couple of chances - it really is a grower."
pos,"The boy's are back. After a slightly disappointing album (not in my opinion, but the public's) in 2011's Mylo Xyloto, the Londoners make their return with the ""stripped-down"" Ghost Stories. Dealing with the pressures of a disintegrating relationship, Chris Martin sings of nothing but love on this 9 song, 40 minute album. Filled with the ambient production of Paul Epsworth and others (even including Timbaland and Avicii), the album has a very laid-back and casual feel to it. Most of these tracks aren't really stand-outs on their own, but as a whole they combine to create a lightweight and fresh feel. 

Opening with ""Always in My Head"", the light and delicate work of Jonny Buckland's guitar and the simple yet soothing sounds of Will Champion on the drum machine, the song has a airy and dreamy quality to it, which is maintained by the rest of the album. 

Two of my favorite tracks on the album, ""Magic"" and ""Ink"" both use thumping beats to create an upbeat and cheery feel. Lyrically neither of these songs, or the rest of the album for that matter, are anything really special. But with Coldplay, its the sum of the parts that counts, and the sum in this case is truly magnificent. 

""True Love"" is an OK track that to me feels like ""Ink"" but with slightly less effort put into it, and a hell of a lot more annoying background sounds. 

Arguably the centerpiece of the album, ""Midnight"" is one of two songs that don't seem to fit into this album whatsoever, with ""A Sky Full of Stars"" being the other. ""Midnight"" is reminscent of Kid A by Radiohead mashed with Bon Iver's vocoder vocals. 

The weakest part of the album consists of the two songs ""Another's Arms"" and ""Oceans"". While ""Oceans"" does sound the closest to old Coldplay we get on this album, the incessant sound of a sonar like beep in the background ruins any and all atmosphere that is trying to be achieved. ""Another's Arms"" lyrically and musically is nothing special, here let Chris Martin's lyrics tell you: 

""Late night watching TV, 
used to be you here beside me"" 

The best song on the album in my humble opinion is the simple yet striking piano ballad, ""O"". Sounding like a mashup of ""Atlas"" and ""Clocks"" it has neither the high production of those two songs, but retains all the emotion and sensitivity that those two have. It simply is the best piece of work that Coldplay have done in the last few years. "
pos,This is a tightly put together album. No wasted or too self indulgent fillers. Easy to listen too with some great lyrics and vocals. A great listen from start to finish.
pos,"I haven't enjoyed a Coldplay album this much since Parachutes. IMO this is Coldplay returning to form with an eye to the future. I love this cd. So much better than Viva la Vida and Mylo Xyloto - I could barely get thru those cds. This is quite, personal and haunting. Just beautiful."
pos,"While I don't think this is up there with Coldplay's first 4 albums, this still captures their more subdued side pretty well, which is refreshing after their decent but really overblown previous album. It's also one of their more diverse albums, going from Parachutes throwbacks to nice simple pop songs that tow the line between earnest & cheesy, to Bon Iver worship to EDM bangers. And yet it still stays pretty cohesive all things considered, which the possible exception of said Avicii collab. The lyrics are also mostly pretty good, centering around themes of loneliness and grief & being pretty compelling at times. The real drawback of Ghost Stories are a few boring songs and occasional lyrics that can get questionably devoted, even by Coldplay standards. But it's still a pretty good album overall. "
pos,"Powerful, thoughtful, and conscious. Coldplay's evolution from Parachutes to Ghost Stories has proven to be an educational journey. Picking up what works and leaving behind what doesn't is this bands specialty. Their best album since A Rush of Blood to the Head."
pos,"Breaks my heart all the time. Made me afraid of love. Chris Martin was never master of lyricism, but he and his team of adept musicians always breathe new life to simple wording like ""leave a light on"".
"
pos,"Thank you, Gwyneth, for such a great record Coldplay put out...."" A Sky full of Stars"" is an absolute hit for 2014 ! This is their best produced record ever, laying almost invisible electronic sounds upon the piano and subtle guitar walls."
pos,"One of the most chill out albums I've ever bought. I'm a big Coldplay fan, and with yet another album with mixed reactions I'll still have to say in my opinion they have hit a home-run once again! This album is completely different than Mylo Xyloto, and I think this is what makes Coldplay one of the greats. Creating a completely different album to the rest but yet still keeping it rooted to their very own style."
neg,"I can't imagine how horrible of an upbringing you would have to have to listen to Brown, and enjoy it. Who can feel sexy listening to cheesy ballads made by a wife beater?"
neg,"Woefully mediocre. How records this flawed can get perfect hundreds is beyond me. It's too long, has terrible sequencing, and there's not enough boldness. It has some nice guitars, but the excellent Square One and Talk barely redeem it."
neg,"Unforgivably bad. They try to exploit the same modus operandi over and over again, showing that they've got run out of ideas, if they someday had any. Avoiding this could be a great idea."
neg,"wow, this has got to be the most over hyped album of ALL TIME. I have listened to it twice and have failed to get ANYTHING from it. It's a boring piece of crap and not one song did anything for me. 4-5 of the songs are shameless rip offs of Clocks, with that same plodding rhythm/bass line combo. Crappy melody the first time and crappy the next 5 times. The rest of the songs are boring piano songs with NO melody. And when i say NO melody i mean nothing. Please don't waste your money on this drivel."
neg,"Coldplay's tendency to water down their albums with mediocre filler is most apparent on this album. While a cohesive, unified sound can work quite well in some cases, it hurts Coldplay here. This comes off as a timid effort from a band that has an aversion to genuine risk-taking."
neg,"Before this album, I was a massive Coldplay fan. This was a HUGE disappointment! Fame clearly went to their heads and they thought they could release any sappy nursery rhyme and the world would eat it up. Unfortunately, that's what happened. Honestly, I can't tell if they were trying too hard or too little with this album.

I've come back to this album several times, months apart, and get nauseous with all but two tracks: White Shadows and Speed of Sound. Those are more what I expected from the album, earning it the two points I give it. No I didn't give up hope on Coldplay, and think they've redeemed themselves with 'Viva la Vida'. Let's only hope that 'The Bakery' delivers, as well ."
neg,"my previous interest in coldplay was based soley upon the song ""the scientist."" a little trite perhaps, particularly compared to what i normally listen to, but screw it, i loved the song. loved loved loved. bought that album, enjoyed 3 or 4 cuts almost as much, but generally felt the album was pretty spotty, which is forgiveable with such great songs thrown in. No forgiveness on this one, though. I moderately enjoyed the single and the first cut on the album, but the rest simply felt like a band who couldn't hit the songwriting side of the barn, so they dressed up all of the songs with typical coldplay things to the max. all the falsetto you can handle, as many spooky ambient synths as their recording gear let them fit (thanks, eno), and that same freaking guitar line and sound OVER and OVER; and they do this for a whole hour! it's the sound of a band missing the mark, of frustration. and, to me, that's frustrating, too, when i've seen the highs this band is capable off."
neg,"I just cannot get into this album, no matter how much I want to. It's background music, my mind just wanders away. As a fan I'm feeling a bit let down. I expected more, I expected a step forward. This does not feel like that. "
neg,"bland, unoffensive, takes very little risks. a huge step backwards for this band that started with so much promise."
pos,"This is a good album with nice lyrics and interesting sounds that, as everybody noticed, remember to those of Bon Iver as well as those of the first album. However the album feels flat, boring and repetitive. The best songs are Midnight, Oceans and O.
"
pos,"This is one of the best albums by Coldplay. They have made me cry with parachutes, have shocked me with AROBTTH, made me dance with MX, and now they have brought it back in a full circle. Nobody can touch my soul as well as coldplay. They are and will remain the best music artists in the world. Period."
pos,"A good Coldplay album. It's not their best, too. It doesn't reach the level of ""A Rush of Blood"" or ""Viva la Vida"", and i don't think that they were trying to create an album that does. This is just a personal work that Chris Martin felt he needed to make. And it, mostly, works. 

The music is soft, warm, and evokes the right feelings (though not emotionally powerful as their earlier stuff). All this is accompanied by Martin's trademark vocal style. The lyrics aren't that great, with a few exceptions. 

My favorite tracks are ""Magic"" and ""Midnight"". There are other very good tracks here, but these are the top in my opinion."
pos,"Great album. This one was not made with a target in mind, instead the band choose to make a honest album. FROM the heart and TO the heart. I think that's were they sound better. Classic Coldplay, with not a single track out of place.Thumbs up."
pos,"Great Effort..Confessional and Heartfelt 
coldplay started with the blue room ep and songs like brothers and sisters..now they have created songs like viva la vida and up in flames..surely this album does not contain these marching anthems but it will still give you shivers..still make you like coldplya because above all we should call it ""true love"" for fans 
Highlight- Magic Midnight Another's Arms and Ink 
Low-O and A sky full of stars 
Buy the deluxe edition..the two new songs are amazing too."
pos,"Do not follow the critics on this one. This is trademark Coldplay with some soulful music. Even the bonus tracks ""All Your Friends"" and ""Ghost Story"" are amazing. This album is also almost entirely electronic for which i have some mixed feelings but nevertheless some great music!"
pos,"A taboo must be addressed before I proceed to actually review the album. The common denominator throughout most reviews I have seen, both from blogs and from major publications, have been accusation, even when the rating given was positive. And then there are the bloggers who have attempted to decipher why people hate Coldplay, as if there is some global misconception that could be lifted, and suddenly everyone is a Coldplay fanatic (there is a widespread misunderstanding of their music, to be sure, but it is not as all-encompassing of anti-Coldplayers as their fans would like to believe). 
It seems that, ever since the release of Parachutes, listeners and critics have made a rather small box for Coldplay to stay inside: ""Here, you can be the sunshine-rock band from England"" (I believe this contributed to the unanimous critical acclaim of A Rush Of Blood to the Head, because it was simply a more mature Parachutes). As soon as X&Y was (delayed, then) released, the change in direction was written off as failed experimentation and, although still carrying big songs like Speed of Sound and Fix You, was mostly called a botched album. Even according to Martin himself, it was only ì60% of what [they] wanted to achieve.î Viva La Vida Or Death and All Of His Friends was their most explorative and interesting album (or double EP, whatever you wish to call it) they have ever released. Songs like Death and All Of His Friends and Lost! are brilliant works of creativity, but were not recognized as such largely because Coldplay was supposed to sound like the people's ""Coldplay,"" the sunshine-rock band from England. 
Ghost Stories is X&Y Part II, except this time Martin and Co. are completely satisfied with the final product. Part of this satisfaction certainly comes from Martin's recovery and reinvigoration with the songwriting process; he is now able, he said in a must-see interview with Zane Lowe, that he has learned to love himself, and thus, others. His confidence and personal ""awakening"", if you will, leads him to appreciate his music without asking the restaurant he's eating in to switch stations as soon as a Coldplay song comes on (which he would do, frequently). 
Coldplay has chosen a direction of brooding and bitter nostalgia with Ghost Stories, and with the help of their manager, production team, etc., have created a brilliant, stunning, themed album. The album cover has multiple allusions, some obvious, some less, to every song on the 9-track album. The decision to forego touring to respect the intimacy that is necessary to Ghost Stories is mature but not surprising for Coldplay whatsoever (i.e. their decision to turn down a multi-million dollar offer from Coke to use Yellow in a commercial spot because it would cheapen the meaning of the song. Coldplay possesses an unheard of amount of artistic integrity, even when they were a newly-emerged international artist). The 4 million dollar amphitheater custom-built for the filming of the album concert, and the subsequent release of the worldwide debut Coldplay ìmovie,î which blended live music with pre-recorded material, was excellent and noteworthy because it hasn't been done like that before. The Jonas Brothers, Justin Beiber, and Katy Perry have released their live concerts, documentaries, whatever they are to be called, but they turned it into an over-hyped theatrical release to generate revenue; Coldplay put it on public television across the world. 
The album is consistent both in theme and in musicality. Some orchestral work on Oceans helps recall the entire songs homage to Viva la Vida..., while a bonus track, named Ghost Stories, could fit in almost seamlessly on a shuffle playlist of Parachutes songs. The bonus track of O was disappointing, given Coldplay's illustrious history of hidden tracks. The transitions between songs are fantastic; listen to the album front to back at least once, don't just skip through tracks. 
Lyrically, Martin has always gotten away with almost (or actually) cheesy lines because... well, because he does. In Ghost Stories, however, Martin's love of cheesy pop music begins to show, and it's disappointing. Awkward reminiscing on Another's Arms and a wimpy admission to the pain of a tattoo on Ink are examples of the kind of lyricism Martin struggles through on the album, almost as if his international stature has halted someone from asking him ""okay, we're still just working through the song, but..... ""Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky, full of stars?"" are you sure?"" Yet we must remember that this is the Chris Martin of The Escapist and Don't Let It Break Your Heart, who can begin the song with ""And,"" say nothing for another three bars, and still hold your attention. 
If someone wants to hear some of Coldplay's best, I would not point them to this album. But if someone wants to hear a work of originality and humble grandeur, in an era of the brash and the bombast, I will gladly refer them to Ghost Stories. "
pos,"Coldplay's newest album is very impressive with great music as usual with it's catchy music and style put into it even if the themes of some of the lyrics are so-so. While I think that A Rush of Blood to the Head and Viva La Vida out beat it IMO, I really enjoyed Ghost Stories; in fact I think all the songs are great to where I can't decide which ones are my favorite; I guess if I had to choose my absolute favorite it would be ""A Sky Full of Stars"" but I also like ""Midnight"" and ""O"". I would recommend this, however I know some older CP fans will probably not like this one as much, but if you can deal with Coldplay's newer style of music then I think that you will enjoy this album."
pos,"Great album. Great Lyrics. Sounds great. It's just a mix of really good beats with powerful lyrics and that wonderful vocals from Martin. Oh, such a nice album. Kind of that album you can hear any time of the day and you will feel good. Since the first song to the last, it makes you feel different things and you stay connected with the music. It is REALLY good. I don't think it's perfect, but it's great, so."
neg,"Another insipid collection of downer tunes to play with your lame art house girlfriend (or boyfriend). Lighten up, boys - life's short - have some fun."
neg,"I usually try to provide a little more explanation than this when I reject a record, but this was just really really really boring. It doesn't really invite any further scrutiny. The second CD was better."
pos,"Been a Coldplay fan for quite some time now and I think it is a wonderful album. People crying about its theme should just go listen to Bieber or Kanye or whatever! This album is gloomy and depressing, and it is absolutely amazing. The only problem with it is sky full of stars, that didn't fit in with the rest. Apart from this, not their best but most certainly not their worst by any standard like people are saying!"
pos,Great album! Must be listened as a whole album and not as independent songs. It brings out a strange lite and the same time dark feel. This atmosphere is successfully captured by the album's cover as well. The songs on this one are not as catchy as some they have released previously. Very unique and not predictable without being complex. Much more mature than Mylo Xyloto.
pos," Like many other die hard Coldplay fans I was looking forward to this album more than anything else this year. With the Martin-Paltrow split in the headlines I can tell you I was already preparing myself for songs which would channel Chrisí emotions from the experience of the breakup. After streaming it on iTunes a few weeks before buying it Iíll be honest and say nothing really stood out to me apart from the Avicii collaboration track ëA Sky Full Of Starsí. The track reminded me of ëEvery Teardrop Is A Waterfallí and seemed to pay homage to the great Mylo Xyloto album, a quality album which sang praises for Coldplayís ability to change with the music direction of music, regardless of how irritatingly electronic it is. 
From this first full listen you could sense the amount of emotion spoken through the sometimes clichÈ and cheesy lyrics, slow synth sounds and the quite evident stripped sound to each of the tracks. 
I get the feeling that rather than make great individual tracks like AROBTTH and MX, the approach with Ghost Stories was to create an album which was best enjoyed listened to as a whole. I think to try to listen to individual tracks alone makes no sense in general, especially in this case as itís like picking a favourite chapters from your favourite book and trying to read them on their own. 
To say that there arenít any tracks you can listen to on their own would be a lie. For all of those who like the ëanthemí tracks like ëClocksí and ëViva La Vidaí, I think ëMagicí and ëA Sky full Of Starsí will suit your fancy. For others who miss and love the sound of the Parachutes album, ëOceansí and ëOí are worthy tracks. 
In conclusion I think Coldplay have given us a good album. Only time will tell how much of a good and maybe great album this will turn into. If we just look at numbers the singles and the album itself is outselling any competition left, right and centre. 
If you are yet to like the album I think listening to it after heartbreak will change your mind. This album to me is like water. At first taste it may not be that special but there will be times which you will need to have it and eventually youíll love its simplicity. I like a few others feel like this album is a sign of better things to come. Coldplay are surely yet to run out of brilliant songs. I expect an album which will blow us away next. For now, we have Ghost Stories to enjoy, an album which might be musical brilliance in its simplest form."
pos,"When I heard Coldplay I really loved it. Their music made me feel alive, happy. I heard about Ghost Stories and I was really excited. It cost me a lot to own it, but when I finally got it, I loved it. When it finished it left me alone, I wanted more, thet¥s why I give it 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Another feeling about the album was the lonleyness that it gave me in Midnight and all the electronic sounds. They got out of their zone, but they did it well!"
pos,"I can't understand why a lot people are hating on this album, as it is just as amazing as their previous ones. It may not sound like the Coldplay most of you have come to love, particularity the A Rush of Blood to the Head era, but you have to accept that they will always continue to experiment with music and do what makes them happy. Also, many of you seem to be forgetting that this is a break-up album that Chris wrote to help him get through his difficulties with his marriage. Still, this is a terrific album, and definitely does not deserve the amount of hate it is getting that I am seeing. "
pos,"Just WOW! This album is one of the best in this year for sure...if not the best from these commercial artists in the world... After really bad Mylo Xyloto Chris and boys have tried do something special, original and memorable, and they did it !! This the best their album by far and even if this album was made in pain and sadness because of broke up Chris and Gwyneth this is still one of those albums what you want to listen all the time without skipping any song on this album. I know people was expecting more Paradise or China with Rihanna, but CP has make something special and personal and you can feel it. This is my 2-3 album in my entire life which i can listen from start to the end. Well done guys and really recommend this album for everyone who really loves music and good feelings becomes from it."
pos,"I think it's very good! It's true that there are new sounds, new rhythms, different from 10 years ago, but it's also true that Ghost Stories has very good songs such as Ink, O and Ghost Story."
pos,"Ghost Stories is the best of Coldplay, really awesome! it is an album that speaks and conveys feelings, emotions, depth and courage! In my opinion the melodies are close to perfection. Each song is a genuine thrill of accomplishment and love. I struggle to believe that they can do better but Coldplay always manage to surprise me. I love this record, I love each song of Ghost Stories."
pos,"I've been a massive fan of Coldplay back since AROBTTH, and I really think this album isn't that bad! 
For starters, we have Always in My Head, which is a brilliant song that ends extremely abruptly. Lyrically, it speaks of sleepless nights and constant thinking of Chris' lover. I would have liked to hear more from where this came from. 
Next is Magic, which on first listen felt a bit cheap, but after a while it really wasn't that bad. It's got a nice bass riff and builds up using the tried and true Coldplay method. Lyrically, it's slightly cliche, with lines like ""Call it magic, call it true. I call it magic, when I'm with you"" but Chris' brilliant falsetto towards the end of the song really pulls it forward 
Then we have Ink. And this is where the album starts getting difficult to listen to, not because of the music, but more of because of the fact that we know that this album is Chris Martin expressing his feelings. Lyrically, it uses a tattoo as a metaphor for love, and that sometimes love can be more painful to get rid off than to fall into. 
True Love is an interesting experiment, with it opening with synthesizers. An interesting point is that this song feels more like Chris Martin feat. Coldplay due to the lack of contribution from the other members of the band. The weakest point of this song, however, is Jonny Buckland's guitar solo. It sounds completely out of context. Lyrically, this song reaches the point of almost begging, with the chorus being ""Tell me you love me, if you don't the lie, oh lie to me."" 
Midnight is intersting, to say the least. Chris' heavily synthesized vocals play only a small part in this completely electronic song. Synths ripple in and out of the constant beat. Overall, I think this song is great. 
The weakest point in the album arrives in the form of Another's Arms. This song simply doesn't sound right, and lyrically is very bland. 
Oceans is almost like a callback to Coldplay's debut album, Parachutes. With a constant beat that sounds like a submarine's sonar, it starts with Chris Martin on the acoustic guitar and ends with the sounds of ocean waves crashing into the beach and what seems like wedding bells. This all builds up to the obligatory stadium filler for this album. 
A Sky Full of Stars. Where do I begin on this one? It opens with not Chris but Avicii on the piano. Meanwhile, Chris is busy using metaphors as usual. Then it builds up to the chorus, where we hear lines like ""Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars, I think I saw you. "" Then Avicii comes and the song explodes into a frenzy of EDM and a subtle but audible guitar tune. 
And now we have O, our obligatory piano ballad. This song is where it really feels like Chris Martin feat. Coldplay. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful piece, but I just feel like the band could have been included a lot more. 

Overall, I feel that this really isn't a bad album. But it could definitely be a lot better."
pos,"This is the best album from Coldplay. I love the songs, especially Strawberry Swing, because it's slow and so relaxing. This album is more intersting than the others."
pos,"I enjoyed this album more than most seemed to have. With it being such an emotional album for Martin, you can tell there's been a lot more though put into the lyrics of this one in comparison to the album before and the album after."
neg,"Another insipid collection of downer tunes to play with your lame art house girlfriend (or boyfriend). Lighten up, boys - life's short - have some fun."
neg,"I usually try to provide a little more explanation than this when I reject a record, but this was just really really really boring. It doesn't really invite any further scrutiny. The second CD was better."
neg,This is a huge disapointment. The lyrcis are so crappy and they're all cliches (Every step that you take/Could be yourbiggest mistake/It could bend or it could break/ But that's the risk that you take). Pure crap! And the transition into a more electronic style is pathetic (prob trying to be compared again with Radiohead). They should stick with they're old stuff.
pos,"While hating this record at the start, I start digging it and definetely enjoy it more than Mylo Xyloto. Simple and flat lyrics of Magic shouldn't distract you from other masterpieces of Chris Martin's songwrighting, such as Ink. And, of course, there is Midnight - the most underrated song in Coldplay's discography, fully deserving some praise. Experemination gone well."
pos,"Ghost Stories was the best album in 2014. because this album had good lyrics , good sounds & heartbroken. Thanks Chris, Jonny, Guy & Will for make this unforgettable album"
pos,"Now it is established: even if Coldplay come up with Sgt Peppers, critics will still hate them. Their lyrics are deeply scrutinized and their attempt at reinventing themselves on every album is seen as aping other bands. By contrast they go gaga over Taylor Swift. Oasis were forgiven through the biggest bad-album streak in history yet Coldplay, a band whose worst album IMHO (Mylo Xyloto) is still leagues better than the rest, are never given a chance. Good thing the general public disagrees. I can't praise this album enough; have a feeling in a few years time this will be regarded as one of the great albums. Neatly bookended by the title track (a track that reminds one of U2's triumphant start to The Unforgettable Fire, A Sort of Homecoming) and the closing track Up and Up, which is haunting, glorious, epic, and melacholy at the same time (with nothing less than a gleaming guitar solo from former scoffer Gallagher), and containing unexpected, shimmering melodies in between, this album works for anyone, Coldplay fan or not. So my message is: NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS, give this album a listen and you will love it. Guaranteed"
pos,"Loved the album a lot and it is according to me 2015's best release. Can't believe critics rated it so low. 
After a few listening s, it grows on you. I say don't go on what critics say and give the album a chance. Tracks like - Hymn for a weekend, A head full of dreams are amazing."
pos,"It is a more lighthearted album that is mostly forgettable. But there are a couple of songs that are good. One is the song ""Hymn For The Weekend"", which in my opinion is the best song on the album. Other songs that are good are ""Adventure Of A Lifetime"", ""Army Of One"" and ""Everglow"". ""Up&Up"" and the title song ""A Head Full Of dreams"" are alright but feel like they are a bit rushed. The rest of the songs are bland and not very good, like they are just there to fill the gaps to make a full album. 

In the end the album is alright, but could have been better, they should have taken more time to add better songs to make this album great. However the few songs that are good make up for the bad ones. "
neg,"If coldplay's head gets any bigger people are going to have evacuate from the island. This cd is awful. The coldplay genre is lame , unexciting , and dying quickly. Once Chris martin hits puberty then maybe the band will be able to mature."
neg,Just plain dreary. Alternative musak. There is no way they are going to topple U2 - U2 have at least totally re-invented themselves a number of times. Coldplay have moved nowhere in almost ten years... their music still sounds like Starbucks.
pos,"After 7 albums, Coldplay deserve to be pleased with themselves, having produced 3 great pop rock albums in ""Parachutes"", ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" and ""Viva La Vida or Death And All His Friends"". What Coldplay should be less pleased about is that the most recent of their truly great albums was released in 2008, almost a decade (and three albums) ago. After the downbeat but likeable ""Ghost Stories"", ""A Head Full Of Dreams"" goes back into Mylo Xyloto territory in terms of tone and texture, pop songs laced with production techniques and studio trickery to make them sound current and contemporary. The problem with this approach (and this can already be seen in Coldplay's back catalogue) is that this month's current sound, whatever it may be at the time, dates incredibly quickly. Coldplay's early material was timeless indie rock gradually progressing to stadium rock. The band's early singles still sound good to those of us who picked them up when they were released. Everything they've done post 2008 has followed a pattern of initially swamping the airwaves and then quickly disappearing, rarely to be heard of again. How often do you hear anything from Mylo Xyloto these days, a mere 5 years after it was released, in comparison to the likes of ""Clocks"" or ""In My Place"". I wouldn't go as far as to say they are now exclusively producing disposable pop but their music is beginning to take on many of that genres characteristics. The point here I guess is that rating ""A Head Full Of Dreams"" now, while it's still relatively fresh, could be a different prospect in a couple of years time. Reviewing it today I have to score it reasonably highly. It doesn't achieve the heights Coldplay hit in the first half of their career but it comfortably sits with what they've produced in the latter half. It's got 11 tracks with track 8 containing 2 songs. 2 of these are interlude type songs that add very little so what we're dealing with is essentially a 10 song album. Half of these tracks are excellently written and produced and while some may dismiss them as ear candy, there is no denying that the tracks are enjoyable. The rest of the material alternates between being average and good. Highlights for me include ""Fun"" with it's outro lifted from ""Viva La Vida"" and ""Army of One/X Marks the Spot"". I can see the Coldplay fans who got on board at the start with ""Parachutes"" struggling to really develop a love for this one and perhaps the Coldplay train is now beginning to run out of steam. Having said that, this is still an enjoyable album and one that I'm glad I bought."
pos,"This album is just so breezy and likable. It's a little painful to listen to with headphones (there's SO MUCH BASS), but listening to it openly (e.g. in the car) is a real joy. There always seems to be a period where a band evolves into a different genre, usually becoming more poppy. This happened to Rush, it happened to Queen, and now it's happening to Coldplay. It's just a period; the band will stay like this for a while and then go back to its roots. Rush went back to its roots in the nineties, twenty hundreds, and twenty tens (e.g. Clockwork Angels), and Queen would have gone back to its roots had Freddie Mercury not died. Coldplay's going to escape this pop period; they'll just be here for a while. While they're here, though, there's a lot to enjoy. "
pos,"A fresh, bright and colorful album by the world`s best band that brings back the Mylo Xyloto vibes. Very very underrated! Every track can be listened to on and on and on."
pos,"I love this album so much. It is much better than Ghost Stories (in my opinion) and is right up there with Mylo Xyloto and Viva La Vida and Death and all his friends. Obviously it is hard to mix the new with the old, but I think Coldplay has really shown that by the end of the careers they will be remembered as one of the greatest live performance acts of this generation, bar none. I have loved Coldplay since I was a child and with each new album release, it is more astounding each and every time (minus Ghost Stories, which was good but I think the weakest of all of their albums.) "
pos,"Good sounds, good lyrics, good rhythm, this album is one of the most brilliant. How always Coldplay does a good job and give us good quality. It qualification should be 100."

pos,"Coldplay has always been producing magical music. Don't ignore these beautiful tracks, listen once and you'll love to listen them all again and again."
neg,"This album was below average. Not just for them, for anybody. I felt that i was listening to the same song over and over and over. Thier other albums were both more varied and more original. To think, this album almost broke up the band. I can see why, it sucks."
neg,"Uninspiring, boring, and trite. Another greedy corporate rock puppet."
neg,"Skullcrushingly dull album, I'm afraid. Martin's lyrics have gone from oblique to bonecrushingly obvious, and matters are made worse by the thick layers of bombast added to every song. Yow. Supposedly they wrote sixty songs for this album. Martin presumably still knows how to write a song. Perhaps in the rejected ones there's an interesting album."
neg,"They are being touted to be the next U2 of the new generation....thats correct...just like the veteran counterparts without any hesitation they could be their three albums and call it X & Y and nobody will see the difference...the same formula...grand, lush and boring...if they are a good band they should come up with good ideas than recycle the same shit. dissappointing"
neg,This is completely unfinished. Kanye clearly put the minimum effort possible into this and as a result none of these songs are coherent
pos,"Their past albums (A Rush of Blood to the Head, Ghost Stories) are still better than this one, but Hymn for the Weekend is amazing, and so are few other tracks. This record just feels too sugary and sweet sometimes."
pos,"I've listened to Coldplay since ""Yellow"" and this is my favorite album since 'X&Y' and second favorite overall. But, this is the type of Coldplay music I like, slow, ballads, melancholy, pop-ish songs!"
pos,"Definitely the best album that Coldplay has ever produced. I listened to this album when it came out without really knowing much about Coldplay except their hit singles, and it became one of the best albums of 2015 and of the 21st century as a whole. The album has easily enough ups and downs to make it interesting, and the tracks each have enough diversity from one another that you don't get bored. All in all, A Head Full of Dreams is definitely the number one album for Coldplay."
pos,"Fantastic album. Is great and dreamy - Perfect for a cold, chill, snowy day with a cup of coffee. Different from their older albums, but still has the classic Coldplay charm attached to it."
pos,"Serene, uplifting, dream-lile, and colorful. The catchiest Coldplay album to date, yet there is something special about it. From Hymn to the Weekend to Everglow, this album is jam-packed with beautiful synths, harmonizing pianos, and wonderful production work. Welcome back, Coldplay!"
neg,"some of his worst lyrics yet on album that feels like an attempt at ""ye being ye"" fan service but ends up being half thought out ideas from someone who needs actual help. sad to see him fall like this."
neg,just the same trash again disappointed rap is just getting bad and bad i can't listen to this
neg,"The positive reviews here are laughable. This album is complete trash and comes nowhere close to replicating Ye's best work. It's 23 minutes long and Kanye is talking, not rapping over at least 6 minutes of that, including basically the entire first song. Uninspired guest spots take up another huge bulk of the record leaving the listener with only a few verses of Kanye rapping in totality. When he does rap, its bad. Like really bad. Cliche and way too on the nose. It basically feels like a boring, self adulating, lecture from a washed up professor. I listened to it all the way through twice to give it a fair chance and I promise I will never listen to any of it ever again. None of these songs are hits or even appropriate to play at parties or in the car. None have staying power. The once great Kanye has become an embarrassment (well he's been that for awhile now)."
neg,I was underwhelmed. Lyrically he was all over the place. Just did not enjoy this album very much and I had been anticipating it.
neg,"I loved Late Registration and College Dropout and I stuck around through the New Ye but this isn't good. The production is understated which could have been good but ultimately just feels like it wasn't finished. And lyrics have never been Kanye's strong point but this album lacked any strong bars at all. 

However I do want to give positives on the fact that this is definitely one of the most emotionally vulnerable Kanye albums we've ever seen. He's more honest, less grandstanding, and more in touch with himself. Hopefully this is just going to build up into a wave for a great future project"
neg,"I guess rhyming the same word with itself and saying a bunch of crazy stuff that doesn't really make any sense is amazing to some people, but not to me. 

Production and delivery wasn't bad so I gave it a few points for that, but it is a zero in terms of the actual rapping and lyrics."
neg,"Given the desperate attempt to hype the album release, I can't say I'm surprised to find Ye severely underwhelming. With 7 tracks clocking in at 23 minutes, it sounds as if Kanye made the album in a matter of weeks and not months or years as was the case with his previous albums, all of which were known for his flawless production and lyricism. As Kanye has descended further down the rabbit hole of Kardashian drug addled madness, his artistry let alone his humanity is nowhere to be found. RIP"
neg,"This fool should stick to producing beats for other artists. He's been releasing irrelevant garbage for the last several years. He's not a smart man. He's not a good rapper. This album isn't worthy of any of the attention it's getting, good or bad. Kanye, just go away."
neg,"No growth from his previous albums... I expected better. This album is instead mundane, repetitive, and unoriginal."
neg,"Mediocre, Bland, Misogynist tones and nothing extraordinary. Kanye West the self proclaimed ""genius"" has officially lost it."
pos,"This is a great album. Very enjoyable to listen to, sway and dance. look out for Birds, Hymn for the weekend, fun and amazing day. The production team do a great job on this one as well. Its definitely not the strongest album coldplay has but its worthy a spot in the discography"
pos,"Another new direction for Coldplay, and a excellent one at that. From the premiere of Adventure of a Lifetime, I knew that this would be something unexpected from Coldplay - an album that is just full of joy and one that makes you want to dance! It's a step towards pop, but that is no bad thing. They've made it their own as they seem to do with anything they try, and succeeded in that! I won't rank all the songs individually, but you can almost tell that this is what the band has been aiming for, with amazing bass lines, beautiful guitar lines, booming drums, and of course, those Chris Martin vocals we've come to love. Some might say it's a little bit cheesy at times, but I like that."
pos,"Iíve just noticed that the covers of Coldplayís albums (at least the last 4 ones), match really well with the overall sound of every project. Not saying I really like them, but the colours, forms and aesthetics define what the album will sound like. Viva La Vida had that Delacroix painting of the French Revolution that was epic as for example the homonime song, Viva La Vida. Mylo Xyloto had a lot of colours and graffitis in the cover, same as I relate the sound, really colourful, with a lot of elements and maybe too much production, and the graffitis symbolize the more young, modern and changed sound of that CD. Then, Ghost Stories and the minimalist cover. The peaceful dark blue match with the more intimate, melancholic and calmed sound (except for A Sky Full of Stars, still donít get the point of putting that EDM **** in that album, also it would had fitted better in this album). And weíre here with AHFOD, with a cover that breaks with the minimalism of the last one, and again adds a lot of colors that reveal the sound itself: more happy vibes, more lightful and danceful songs, a lot of synths and electronic elementsÖ everything reminds a little bit to Mylo Xyloto, but this time with funk and dance. But the cover kinda reveals one of the problems of this: too much elements. There is an excess of production. Also it seems there is not a well defined direction in the album, a problem of combining producers of different genders on the same disc. Matter of fact, the only parts I really like are these kind of interludes. I think AHFOD is far from the level of Mylo Xyloto but, you know what? I donít blame Coldplay after all. This album is conceived to be played and performed live. Thatís why Ghost Stories didnít have a tour. Songs like ìMagicî or ìMidnightî are not adequate to be played live at all. And this album is actually a right move in practical terms. It is an enjoyable album if you know, as I did, what youíre expecting to listen here. And I was prepared to listen another different Coldplay, moving even further than the sound of their first 3 albums. There are no good lyrics in this album cuz they donít even care. Coldplay made this album for the temporary joy, not as a permanent reminder in this bandís legacy. "
pos,"This album has been amazing from the start from when we heard it, I find Adventure of a lifetime as a song which could always make you happy and same for the album it is just a great piece of thank you to the fans, hopefully Coldplay won't be gone for long because the music they produce is just out of this world, a true British band indeed."
pos,"It's Coldplay, music turns into magic. What's so incredible about them is, they've never dono anything like the albuns before, such as Parachutes, Viva La Vida. It's pretty much a journey where they can print their own mark into anything. I'm glad Coldplay's still around."
pos,"This new album by Coldplay is amazing. All the songs are catchy, fun and really inspiring. These critic review are so stupid; this deserves a way higher score. All the songs in this album are amazing and I will never get tired of it. This music is not only a new and exciting but it also still sounds like the Coldplay we have listened to and loved forever."
pos,"One of the better albums of 2015. 
More of a pop album from Coldplay. But if merging Pop with alternative rock is a thing, Coldplay did it the best way possible."
pos,"Martin and the gang have a head full of dreams. These dreams are manifested in the tracklist being every type of song they've ever wanted to make. This culmination of the bands dreams accompanied by their friends and family is the definition of Coldplay in the most literal sense. This is admirable and, of course, very catchy."
pos,Sounds nice from front to back. A good companion album for Ghost Stories which I also really enjoyed. The album actually does a nice job of sounding a little bit like all of Coldplay's previous soundscapes in different parts. Not disappointed at all.
pos,"Before purchasing the album today, I had read some reviews from critics. They all seemed to be fairly negative and I was wondering whether a purchase made any sense even though I had every other Coldplay album. Then, I watched ""Adventure of a Lifetime"" on Youtube and was immediately hooked to the sound. I just finished listening to the whole album: one 5-star song ""Adventure of a Lifetime"", two 3-star songs, two deleted (the 1-minute tunes) and the rest 4-stars. It's actually quite strong and one of the better albums they've come up with. If anything, it's a very happy addition to their collection."
pos,"A lot of the negativity for this album seems to come from fans previous expectations. Coldplay has become an ever-evolving band who seem to change style ever album now. While I would say this album is not the new Mylo Xyloto, I still very much enjoy it. The songs are catchy, uplifting, and fun. Everglow has become one of my personal favorites by them. If you go in with an open mind, I think you'll enjoy it."
pos,"I reaaaally liked this album, it's so fresh and catchy, and the songs have quiet and nice sounds. Obviously this album is better than their previous project ''Ghost Stories'' but not as good as ''Parachutes'', ''A Rush Of Blood To The Head'' or ''Viva La Vida''. 8 for me."
neg,"What a piece of garbage. Everything on this album (if you can really call it that) is nothing but distilled EGO. There is absolutely nothing of worth here and it a massive waste of your time and money. Spend both elsewhere, Kanye is washed up."
neg,"Trash, mediocre, deserves to flop, Kanye should retire, why is wife famous again?"
neg,Sonically ambivalent about its message and too brief to distill anything substantial to its listeners.
neg,"short, messy, totally lacks anything that could be labelled a 'hit', disposable, awful guest vocals, sore thumb production choices, entirely throwaway. I think that's the statement? I think that's the point? All the same, pass"
neg,"reputation outsold, outimpacted, outcharted, outviewed & outeverything'ed 
kanye west is OVER
"
neg,"A Trump supporter and someone who disparages mental health on his album cover. I couldn't make the rating go any lower, so a zero it is. I used to love Kanye despite his insanity and inability to connect with normal humans. No more."
neg,"There is nothing new to be learned from this album burdened by crudely formed raps about his already exhaustively covered life and deeply muddled politics. ... Still, the music at times almost makes it worth it."
neg,kanye doesnít reward repeat listens. It gives its limited treasures upfront and itís an album with precious little beneath the surface
pos,"To appreciate this new Coldplay's album, you must definitely have in mind that the British band evolved a lot since ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" (to most, their best album to date) and ""Parachutes"". Following the disappointing 2014 ""Ghost Stories"", Chris Martin and his friends bring new material to the old and usual one on ""A Head Full Of Dreams"". 

Yes, some ballads are classic post-""Viva La Vida"" Coldplay. Yes, the album doesn't have a lot of outstanding hit records on it. Yes, it might seem at first like everything sounds the same. To be absolutely honest, ""A Head Full Of Dreams"" isn't very surprising. Coldplay called some guests here and there and none of the collaborations (except maybe one - I'll talk about it later) really bring something to the record. But what makes ""A Head Full Of Dreams"" a much better album than the previous one is that it is a much more creative one. By adding funk and fun, colorful tones and significant guests (Gwyneth Paltrow, Barack Obama, Noel Gallagher ...) to their usual artistry, the band offers something really joyful and refreshing to their fans. Something you'll like to listen to for the next few months. 

The ballads ""Amazing Days"" and ""Everglow"" are typical from Coldplay but they prove that the magic still works. The emotional track ""Army Of One"" is the perfect indie pop song you'd expect from the band. The only real surprise might be the BeyoncÈ-assisted ""Hymn For The Weekend"", the proof that once in while Coldplay can create an unexpected and potentially successful hit record. On a ""A Head Full Of Dreams"", it is an unique and uplifting party anthem. 

So yes, ""A Head Full Of Dreams"" is an unsurprising album, and it will definitely be a huge disappointment to those still hoping for ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" 2.0, but Coldplay still manage to find some ways to be creative, and even though this creativity may seem minimal on most songs, it is obvious on some others - the best songs of the albums, and the few ones we'll remember. 

This is clearly not a good ""final"" album, but something tells me it's not, so let's get to the facts : it's a very enjoyable and fun record. If you're a Coldplay fan or you just enjoy listening to colorful indie music, ""A Head Full Of Dreams"" will be the perfect album for your winter 2015-2016. But if you expect something musically outstanding and complex, you truly should forget Coldplay's name one and for all."
pos,"I see the evolution in the band, but I saw some slippage. The album came good, with participation as Tove Lo and Beyonce, but I missed those holdings in the music itself. 
Much has been speculated saying that the last album, if I think they close this cycle very well. The album is not strenuous, calm music and lyrics that address the proposal. 
Of course, I could improve. But I liked these traits from other genres they brought. I confess that not enjoyed the last album of them, ""Ghost Stories"" and didn't expect much from ""A Head Full of Dreams"". But they did a good job. Congratulations Coldplay."
pos,"This album is lyrically genius. Like any album, it takes a while to grow on you. These songs are truly addicting. Best songs are definitely ""Fun"" ""A Head Full of Dreams"" and ""Up&Up"". The album's theme really does match the sound. Pop, colorful, fun."
pos,"Going into this album, I had some expectations: it should be a bit livelier, more colourful and more visceral than their previous record, Ghost Stories (although the album's cover art pretty much gave me an answer beforehand), but I didn't want it to have the electronic excesses of Mylo Xyloto (it's a great album, but if they make a sequel, it won't be anywhere near as good as MX. Coldplay took a risk and made a very experimental pop album, and it worked; that doesn't guarantee that a follow-up will). 
I was pleased by the production on a lot of these songs, and how organic they sound. You can tell that they've been made by real instruments, not by pressing a bunch of buttons on a computer. The album kicks off with an uplifting title track that was made for the arena; no wonder Coldplay opens all of their live shows with it. ""Birds"" has a lovely guitar melody, and is a pretty tune that bursts with colour on the chorus. ""Hymn for the Weekend"" brings a lot of energy, Chris Martin and Beyonce sound good together, but for me it falls a little flat due to the sub-par lyrics, and the whole song feeling like it's trying a bit too hard to make you want to dance. 
Things get very melancholic on ""Everglow"", a lovely piano ballad in which Martin sings about a constant source of light and positivity in his life. It's a poignant moment that you just want to soak up. ""Adventure of a Lifetime"" and ""Fun"" follow, two vibrant tracks with forgettable lyrics. The former, also the lead single, fizzes with energy and has nice guitar work while the latter, featuring Tove Lo, is a slightly slower pop tune about... well, having fun. They're decent tracks, but they feel more like B-sides from Mylo Xyloto, especially ""Fun"". 
The subdued pseudo-interlude (regular interludes don't last 2 minutes) ""Kaleidoscope"" has something very alluring about it; I can't quite put my finger on it. There's something about a dramatic reading of an introspective poem over a soaring piano melody that I like so much. Barack Obama sings ""Amazing Grace"" on this one, too! ""Army of One"" explodes with synth, powerful vocals which get chopped up in some parts, and booming percussion. I love it. The hidden track here sounds like it was placed there by mistake (it sounds completely different from the main track), but it just about works. It's a suitable comedown from the dizzying heights of ""Army of One"". 
Coldplay grab the 'gratitude' dial and turn it all the way up on ""Amazing Day"", a very pretty guitar-led tune which features the perfect concert sing-along moment in the bridge. Martin really delivers with his vocal performance here. The interlude ""Colour Spectrum"" is a calm medley of some of the previous tracks, although if you're going to have an interlude when there's only one track left, you need to be sure you're setting up one hell of a finale. That is exactly what ""Up&Up"" is. Coldplay save the best for last with a dramatic rock ballad, with lyrics on hope and optimism, a triumphant guitar solo from Jonny Buckland and a second one from guest Noel Gallagher. When Martin says it's ""the song that they've been waiting to write for fifteen years"", I don't doubt it. The eerie ""believe in love"" coda at the end does a wonderful job of bringing the album to a close."
pos,"A Head Full of Dreams' may be lowest Coldplay album musically talking, but it show us they can do any genre. The lyrics and the emotions are well played, but making it more electro-based makes this album worthless than the others."
pos,"They're probably the rock band that the pop fans like the most and this album it's going to increase this status, specially with the likes of BeyoncÈ and Tove Lo being guest artists. Some happiness is always good, even if the album has some depressive moments."
neg,"Yeezus is ultimately most repugnant in how it heedlessly collapses all the value dichotomies that Kanye has mined so fruitfully over the years into one bottomless cesspool of narcissism.
"
neg,"Sonically, this is a great departure for West, and it's pretty exciting. But thematically, this is absolutely nothing new, for him or hip-hop/rap. But you can't just have a good album with just music alone, and unfortunately his lyricism and tone just completely destroy this album could have had. Maybe I am being harsh with a zero, but I guess hyped destroyed it as well. I was expecting something great with all the raving from everybody, but with the expectations set before me this album was pretty underwhelming. I agree with a user who said this earlier. A lot of the praise for Kanye simply comes from him being Kanye, not that he actually does anything good or not. And sadly, this time he did not."
neg,"I don't like it not even a little. Kanye placed the goal of innovation over the goal of making good music. The production has its moments, but slips too often into a rumbling synths, bassy buzzsaws, high-pitched metallic shrieks that overshadow what little lyrical element exists but that's preferable to the hamfisted lyrics. 

Kanye may have abandoned catchy production and mass appeal, but his lyrics burned the bridge. Kanye has always been a juxtaposition, mixing the fragility and transparency of a glass champagne flute with the narcissism and braggadocio that is typical of hip hop. Kanye has fallen (or jumped) from this tight-wire balance, landing deep within the infinite void of his own ego. The lyrics are self-exalting, self-congratulatory and self-centered. On more than a few tracks, Kanye is battling old shadows with incendiary lyrics, responding to echos with a rebuttal to the choir no one is arguing the point anymore, but Kanye continues to tantrum on; not with the witty lyrics of his past albums, but with brutish blusters, caterwaul screams, and childish yowls laced with production cuts and reverb. And, when the time comes, Kanye delves into closet of hiphop's past and drags out the autotune to compliment his tired arguments. 

Kanye's flow ebbs due to a conscious decision to adopt the slow-paced percussive style of southern rappers that bounce over club bangers. Kanye's wavering confident self-aware delivery of the past that made his previous records so great is nowhere to be found, but is certainly missed. 

The media will, of course, gush over the emperor's new clothing, with words like 'brave' and 'genius', but it will only be lip service and mouthed praise. Deep down this isn't about His music, this is about Him as a concept, and idea, a brand. the media's love affair with Kanye was built on the foundation of quality music, but in the wake of countless spectacles of egotism, and displays of self-unawareness, supported by unearned comparisons have laid the brickwork to this taj mahall, Kanye mutters to a reporter, ""I am the best ever"" and those words migrate to the front of music magazines and the world begins to echo back kanye's own praise, first framed as a question, but like all echos, the end trails off and the statement, ""Kanye is the best"" becomes a statement. And he has been the best, he has been really really good, but not this time, and no one will have the guts to tell the self-crowned emperor that he is naked. 

I applaud Kanye's vision and ambition to continually grow and change as an artist, but new isn't always better, and sometimes it's terrible. Kanye's music is lacking the soulful sweetness and depth that counteracts his acerbic ostentatiousness. I won't be buying this album, and I will certainly be more skeptical of any subsequent releases."
neg,he lyrics are lazy and the production is not interesting enough to warrant wasting space on my ipod. Nothing and I mean nothing on this album is worthy of a 10.
pos,"First time i'm listen to head full of dreams, i'm thought it's just a waste album.But after few times listens whole album i changed my mind.Birds and Fun are my most favorite songs from head full of dreams."
pos,"Another colorful album from Coldplay. They already trying to make colorful album like Mylo Xyloto, and the result was less than compelling. When they release AHFOD, i've got a bad feeling about it. But, i was wrong. Indeed, it's not the best from Coldplay, but it's way better than Mylo Xyloto (in my opinion). The songs are ear-catching, only Kaleidoscope, Birds, and Amazing Day that a little bit annoying to me. But overall, it's nice to see that finally Coldplay success to make a great colorful album. This is just my opinion, what's yours?"
pos,"I would agree that it is not as good as we expected from Coldplay. It is absolutely not their best album so far. They are still capable of making a far better album than previous ones. On a scale of 10, I would give 8.5 for A Head Full of Dreams."
pos,"""A Head Full Of Dreams"" with production Digital Divide, Rik Simpson, Stargate. The result is a risky album that hour makes us have good of nostalgia and old alternative rock band, other makes us want to dream and travel through the dreams of Chris Martin and also land in a world never seen before and shout for all to hear that the trip was amazing. Amazing Day ."
pos,"It seems to be exactly what it is. Many people say that an artist's album cover can describe exactly the songs it contains in it, this is the case of a full head of dreams, colorful, cheerful, and brings a message, like all Coldplay albums. It's scary to a point, when you're accustomed to the band's old-sounding, but with time you'll go to accepting this phase of Coldplay and so enjoy your new jobs. "
pos,"Not one of Coldplays most glorious releases, still far better then most of the music that is produced nowadays. It's like they've adapted the mainstream sound of pop but there's still that lovely feeling of warmth and intimacy like always in Coldplays music."
pos,The best album of them... they just inspiring me to be better person and love everything.
pos,"AHFOD is an attractive, highly-enjoyable album. This is mostly due to the consistently interesting, original modern melodic pop-rock music, which works very well throughout the album. The music on this album is warm, interesting, engaging, and very pleasant for the most part. The music works very well with the vocals and the optimistic, warm lyrics. ""Head,"" ""Hymn,"" ""Adventure,"" ""Army"" and ""UpandUp"" all sound great in their own ways. ""Everglow"" has great piano-pop infused music, and ""Birds"" has a warm, pleasant energy to it. 

Lyrically, this album is nearly as impressive, and occasionally bad. ""Hymn"" has pretty terrible lyrics, along with (to a lesser extent) ""Fun,"" and the second half as ""Army."" Still, the lyrics are rarely downright offensive or hard to listen to. Lastly, the vocals on this album are solid, and blend very well with the music and lyrics. 

AHFOD us an engaging, vibrant, warm, occasionally magical album in terms of music. It is not terrible lyrically, but it's not very interesting or original. All in all, I really do enjoy this album."
pos,"Upon first listen I can see why old school Radiohead fans won't like this album, I didn't either. After a few listens though the album grew on me. Radiohead took a leap of faith here by making an album totally opposite of their past masterpieces (The Bends & OK Computer). This transition kind of reminds me of Dylan going acoustic. His loyal folk fan base was horrified and didn't want anything to do with him after that. Thankfully artists make music for themselves and what that is and what the fans want may be two different things. If artists just stuck to their roots we they would never be able to grow intellectually and musically. Kid A is a fantastic album and is well worthy of all the praise it has and continues to receive and ""Everything In It's Right Place"" is one of the best songs of all time."
pos,"When I first listened to this album, I thought it was entirely a pile of garbage. How could the greatest rock band in the world make such a horrendous processed electronic earwreck? A month later, I gave it another chance. Then I thought, ""huh, this is alright. Wonder why I thought it was so bad."" Then I listened to it for a third time. That's when my mind was blown. Radiohead had struck."
pos,resonance - A magazine that might've been amazing if the writers had only bothered to write some actual reviews.
pos,"Words fail me. A pioneering, post-genre masterpiece. Easily the best album of the 21st century. Period."
pos,"undeniably beautiful, and after 50 listens, it seems even better"
pos,This album is more than just music. It is a visceral experience.
neg,"great production but it sounds like an instrumental album 

extremely bad rapping and extremely bad lyrics. 
Kanye definitely needs to step his game up"
neg,"Kanye West is a lyrical genius. He showed it on this one. My favorite song on this whole album was ""Hold My Liquor"" with Cheif Keef. It's pretty bad for THAT to be the best song. ""Bound 2"" was just annoying, the beat was just weird with the voice in the back round. I disliked this album ALOT"
neg," It's pretty damn sad... when a person cannot make it through a ""musical"" album. Kanye...you f*cking suck...even at naming babies...you fucking suck. I wonder if you were on meth when you were making this album"
neg,"I can't understand where all of the positive hype about this album is coming from. I understand how original Yeezus is and all the risks 'Ye took in releasing this with no true single and such... I get it. However, that doesn't instantly forgive the abominable lyricism of this collection of songs. Kanye used to produce and write some of the most inspirational and well produced music in the hip hop genre. Now he takes a leap of faith that falls incredibly short and people are loving the fact that he jumped, not the music itself. It is definitely original and it pushes the boundaries, but none of these songs are songs that you can really listen to and enjoy"
neg,It's because of this album's metacritic score I've decided to kill myself. As long as albums by Drake and Kanye are getting higher ratings than great artists like Eminem I don't want to live here. Lyrically his album is trash. Kanye used to be decent but now he's just horrible.
neg,"The worst Kanye's album, i like the fact that he's tryna experiment with his music, but this time he failed. The best song on the album is ""Black Skinhead"", where he fuse the industrial music with the hip-hop, and it's sounds pretty good, but in the album there are HORRIBLE songs, like ""Bound 2"", sounds like a bowl full of **** and the other songs are bad, songs like ""Blood on the Leaves"" doesn't need to exist. Hope that his next album will be much better"
pos,"you'd have to like free jazz and modern classical music to like what radiohead did with rock music. it's music not for a commercial audience, but for real lovers of music."
pos,"Everything radiohead does is unbelievable (besides pablo honey)... i think the band peaked at ok computer, but this album is still unbelievable."
pos,"Quite simply one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Not to everyone's tastes, but certainly to mine."
pos,I would give this album an 11 if i could. If you do not understand kid A you might as well stop listening to music altogether. you lameoids who gave this album a bad rating sholuld perish in one of Dante's concentric circles of hell that Thome Yorke so emotionally transends to us in his flawless and dominating voice. Why don't you invalids go off on an island somewhere with your Ben Kweller and O.A.R. cd's and leave the rest of us alone. Be sure to bring a t.v. because i know you can't miss American Idol.
pos,"I hated this record when I first heard it. However, I now consider it to be the greatest record that I've ever heard."
pos,This album tells a story of simple men/women enduring complex ideas with johnny greenwood (etc.) composing the sound scape. Its brilliant. I wish more albums like this would come along. Until then.
pos,A masterpiece. The only album I still listen to constantly 2 years later in 2002. Radiohead has taken the otherworldly sounds of Aphex Twin & Autechre and made it slightly more accessible. And what other major band has taken a risk like this? U2? The Beatles? That's good company if you ask me.
pos,"tired of everyone saying you have to listen to it more than once to get it. The first feeling that you get after the first listen ... cannot put my words together. every listen something new rises up. every listen some part of your brain or heart gives out. i will stop now, but it is one of the best records ever made, still dont know how it reached #1 when it came out, myabe because of ok computer buzz.

neg,"I seriously have an issue with all the positive critics this album is receiving; I still can't understand it. 

This album supposedly had all the elements to success with the rooster of producers on the track, I was expecting a great Daft Punk Yeezy collaboration, totally waiting for it... but it turned out ridiculously. 

I can understand the concept of changing the style, moving to industrial music, mixing it with Hip-Hop and Acid house, creating a new fusion genre (sort-of)... but this absolutely ridiculous. On ""Guilt Trip"" he even went further to introduce 8-bit bass synthesizer. The samples are horrible too, sampling screwed up a potentially nice track like ""Bound 2"". 

Kanye West's lyrics are the most narcissist, and it's sad because other than ""New Slaves"", the whole album revolves around ""Screw your music, I go home to bang Kim Kardashian every night"" (""I am a God"" is a proof) 

Still I find the track ""Blood on The Leaves"" to be a cool track, the Nina Simone sample created a great amp along the dirty-brass and piano melodies. ""Send it Up"" might be rocking clubs within a few months probably the drum-line in ""Black Skinhead"" is nice. And that's that for the album. 

Yeezus is totally overrated and underwhelming in my opinion, an experimental album that totally ""went Chernobyl"", specially on a production-level; hopefully we can move along that as soon as possible."
neg,"10 songs in a full album is a rip! He goes overboard with the beats. Raps about himself all the time. Impossible to relate to his album. The beats hurt you ears, too hyped."
pos,"To call Kid A a good album is an understatement, while not as diverse and as good song by song as its predecesor Ok Computer, Kid A may be better as a full collective album. Its one of those albums that it is almost required of you to listen from start to finish. While it is an album that definetely has a recurring musical theme, each song takes you to a different place, whether it be the chilling ""Everything in its Right Place"" to the near tear jerking ""How to Disappear completely, to the anything but ""Optimistic"", to ""In Limbo"" which most certainly lives up to its name being confusing and without real direction (in a good way). Kid A while not Radioheads magnum opus, may be their most obscure, challenging, and most thought provoking piece of art, which it is nothing less than a piece of art."
pos,"When you ask people about the best 90's album, the most common answer is: ""OK Computer"". And they go beyond in asserting that also is the best Radiohead album. I'm not in agreement with the last affirmation. ""Kid A"" is a huge album that overcomes their previous recording. Since I first heard it, 6 years ago, I was impressed by it's peculiar sound, the experimentation, the quality, the elegance. It's a masterpiece! (for me, of course). Since these High School days it has becomes one of my favorites recordings of ever!"
pos,"The best Radiohead's album of the last twelve years. Nothing more, nothing less. It's absolutely worth listening to it, but if you never liked them this album is not gonna make you change your mind. Haters are warned!"
pos,"An album that both alienates listeners yet draws them back in for more. Kid A is quite possibly the most unique sounding albums and constructed ideas of the last several decades. The stripped down sound of the ""new era"" Radiohead of the 21st century does more than cement their place as one of the most influential bands of all time and without question, one the best bands of all time."
pos,"Kid A is indubitably one of the best albums of the past decade, and Radiohead's crowning achievement. Rarely have I listened to an album so cohesive and unified. Every song paints a beautiful picture and the songs flow from one to each other so naturally. Listening to this album, I experienced the sensation one has while watching a good plot twist in a movie. I felt my previous notions of the world disassembled. It was an ethereal but otherworldly experience. It's like if ""Everything in its Right Place"" sets the stage for the events of the album, ""Kid A"" shows the unbridled innocence of the world we see, and then something really, really bad happens on ""The National Anthem"". The rest is survival. The lyrics, bizarre and arbitrary as they might seem on first glance, really have a distinct purpose serving the atmosphere of the song. Could you imagine ""Everything in its Right Place"" without the now iconic ""I woke up sucking on lemon"" line? 

The musicianship here is impeccable. ""Everything in its Right Place"" is an almost hypnotic trance in 10/4 time that leaves you simultaneously disturbed and intrigued. ""The National Anthem"" features blistering horns and brass that slowly metamorphoses into hectic hysteria, which the bass line still serving as an undercurrent of survival and hustle and bustle beneath. Brilliant. ""How to Disappear Completely"" is an acoustic ballad, but not in the traditional sense, and feature's Greenwood's Penderecki-esque string arrangements. ""Idioteque"" sees the band exploring some bleak territory in its lyrics hidden beneath the veneer of a dance song, while songs like ""Optimistic"" and ""In Limbo"" defy genre classification. 

This is a really magnificent piece of work. The only drawback is that it's not very accessible for a casual listener. But for those willing to take on this accomplishment, you will be heavily rewarded. It's a fantastic album and work of art and I highly recommend you listen to it altogether. "
pos,Arguably one of the best albums of the 21st century so far. Radiohead demonstrates their ability to blend electronic sounds with a deliverance of words that are heavy and moving beyond comprehension.
pos,it's like a punch to the face of rock at the time and it experiments with the best of the band techniques. from electronic to jazz sounds is one of the most strong albums of the decade
pos,"How did this album not get an 81? Who the hell are Resonance why did they give it only a 30? Wait a minute, I know. It's a review that might've been amazing if only the critic bothered to write it."
neg,"This album is pretty disappointing. Nothing bold or creative about it. It drones on for the first half of the album, has a couple of average songs, then sputters against towards the end. I think he has too much going on in his life to put out a great album atm. Hopefully future efforts will be better, because this was disappointing."
neg,"I would like to say I'm a Kanye West fan, but this album is complete garbage. It is lacking in the lyrical ingenuity or anywhere near the quality of beats ias in n any of his previous solo album. I have no clue how much Spotify paid for this, but i want a refund."
neg,"I don't know how people keep buying this insufferable tripe. His lyrics are not only offensive and brash, but they are down right idiotic. For example, lets take the song ""New Slaves"". A clarion call towards the ills of capitalism, Kanye being pigeonholed by an industry, with an emphatic statement reminding his black brothers that we are the ""New Slaves"" to the corporate master. Not a bad message, if it wasn't so hypocritical. Kanye West, or rather the Louis Vuitton Don (his old moniker) himself is a corporation, with ties to Nike via his Air Yeezus lines as well as his own clothing companies. He has crafted a song entirely aimed at exposing the ills of capitalism, and yet, he hasn't the hindsight to look into his own life and see that the clothing lines he either supports, endorses or manufactures are largely made in sweatshops. While this is just one song that i find trouble with, the confusing messages/themes run rampant throughout this album. The music is top notch, well produced, and finely crafted, something that we have all come to expect from Kanye. However, I cannot get passed the lyrics on this one."
neg,"Garbage! pure, unfiltered garbage. Praise Jesus if you can make it through the first song without feeling nauseous. I have been a Ye fan since Freshman Adjustment and this is by far his worst work. Nothing inspiring, nothing worth mentioning even (other then the lines we all know..'crossiants'). What a let down top 10 of the worst rap albums I've listened to"
pos,Bloody Perfect. Everything in its right place is the song. I can't think of any album that comes close to this. The 80 on metacritic proves how stupid some people are when it comes to art.
pos,Albums like these that push musical boundaries so far that you can't even see where it started are hard to come by that do it so beautifully and precisely. This is a record that is a MUST LISTEN to anyone. EXPERIENCE THIS MASTERPIECE.
pos,I feel sorry for you if your brain isn't able to comprehend the beauty of this record.
pos,"Easily, one of the best albums of the last 25 years, hell EVER? Radiohead, Radiohead, Radiohead... this album is nearly flawless... One thing I must say though... Treefingers seems to get a lot of filler talk thrown at it... NOPE! great song."
pos,one of the best alternative album. very experimental.
pos,"Kid A is not a msterpiece, for it is far too many flaws and several poor songs. But it is extremely innovative; I never had heard anything like it when I picked it up and haven't heard anyting similar since. Impatient listeners beware: you need to listen to this at least twice befote you start enjoying it. An album that seems to get better with each play."
pos,"One of the most intricately beutiful and shocking albums your ever likely to hear. Its better then just music, it makes music seem silly and childish, the masterpeice of the best band who have ever recorded a sound"
pos,"Very nice album, one of the reviews summed it up perfectly: you have to listen to it all the way through, and you will find something beautiful. For those of you complaining about no actual songs, what would you call number 1, 6, 8, 4, 9, and 10. All have melodies (although ten almost has no beat, but still is my favorite song). As for the remark Kiwi made about no one listening to the album I'm sure is very accurate, since I'm sure she's talked to all of the millions of Radiohead fans. "
neg,"Maybe I'm overreacting by rating it a 0, but this album is just not for me. The sounds are very displeasing to my ears, and they made me literally cringe. The only songs that are okay to me are Blood on the Leaves and Bound 2, and even on both of these songs I feel Kanye messed up my vibe. 

Many people enjoy this album, but I just don't. Simple as that.
"
neg,"Album is rubbish, hurts my ears, this isnt music its screaming, kanye needs to lay off the drugs and get back to that college dropout style, also hes a gayfish"
pos,Radiohead's best album to date and my favorite album ever.
pos,Great Album from a truly great band
pos,"It's 2am and you're laying in bed alone. You surrounded by complete darkness: no street lights, no moonlight. You press play on your CD player and the first notes of 'Everything In The Right Place' begins. It's ethereal; it's beguiling; it's frightening. An album of contradictions: it perfectly captures the mood of the turn of the century. You can not do without it."
pos,"Like many people have mentioned, it takes multiple listens to fully appreciate the brilliance of this album. In my opinion it's Radioheads best and most daring album to date."
pos,"Extroardinary. Impossibly beautiful and immensely moving. Reminds me less of rock music then the world's greatest composers: J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven--oh yea--Miles Davis and Charles Mingus as well. One of the greatest albums ever made."
pos,"Wonderful in places (Optimistic, In Limbo, Idioteque), occasionally shocking (Treefingers - was someone leaning on a keyboard?) but very pleasantly surprising - I never thought I'd have an album with the line ""Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon"" in it, let alone to have it repeated a few times . Generally excellent"
neg,Good beats poor lyrics. Yeezie the beezie just doesn't have the life experience to say anything interesting. If you would like to know the latest name brands to purchase pickup the album or the latest GQ. Oh and did he mention how cool he was?
neg,"There is no substance to this ""album"". I grew up listening to actual innovators of music....Kanye falls way short of this. This sound that he is trying to pass off as ""revolutionary"" is like cancer to your ears. The younger generation may love this CD, but that just proves how far music has fallen. Save your money, don't buy this 10 track travesty. The production is all bad, the lyrics feel forced and uninspired, and the man is claiming to be a god. The packaging of the album should tell you the story of what you are getting with your purchase, a lackluster attempt at trying to revolutionize music without trying. If he is still selling this well then the sheep that listen to this garbage are all brain washed by his antics. He's a pretty transparent person when you really step back and look at it. ""I don't want to be famous"" only holds so much weight while you are laughing all the way to the bank with the peoples money you just stole. If you really aren't doing this to be famous, donate that money to someone who needs it. Stop lying and calling yourself an artist. All of the real hip-hop heads have already seen through your skirt wearing facade."
neg,"I think it is a very boring album, with nothing new to offer. All the hype is for nothing. People like this music because they are told it is good through different medias, but it is nothing more just pop music, in a fancy packaging, which want you to believe it is unique."
pos,"The famous lyricist Yip Harburg once said, ""Words make you thing, music makes you feel, songs make you feel thoughts."" This is exactly what I get from Radiohead's Kid A. To say that this album or any abum for that matter is pretentious just doesn't make sense to me. How can anyone advocate for change without those against that very change saying they're pretentious. Radiohead clearly makes music for the sake of making music. They refuse to sell their albums on iTunes because they don't want to sell their songs by themselves for they feel each album is its own entity and the songs only make sense in the context of the album. This band pushes the boundaries of music. They are the only widely known band to do so not necessarily the best at it but still they are doing it. This album requires an open mind when it comes to music. While I believe that there is an abundance of melody on this album I stand by the fact that nowhere is it set in stone that melody needs to be in music. Sure we all like a melody but why create a cheap melody for the masses if its not in the songwriters mind? Songwriting is an expression of what someone is feeling and this is what Radiohead wanted to make at this time. Personally I think Hail to the Thief is their greatest triumph but Kid A must be respected as part of the miraculous journey of Radiohead."
neg,"Honestly, nothing impresssive. Very pretentious and try-hard from start to finish. This exaggerated praise will prove to do nothing but inflate his already overblown ego."
pos,"No album is more important to me than this one. 7 years in and 100s if not 1000s of listens to later, it still blows me away. A true masterpiece."
pos,"A masterpiece among masterpieces. This one is for the time capsule. Truly one of the best albums every crafted. The Pitchfork review is beautiful, and dead-on."
pos,"i dont like the album as much as my review implies. when it comes to my enjoyment its a 7, but kid a is so impressive its a 9 and as time passes will probly end up as a 10. that being said, its much easier to repspect than love. much."
pos,"As beautiful, jarring, ultimately comforting experience. Subdued revolution at its finest."
neg,"The songs are generic and very un-inspired, West has fallen off, every single song sounds like a filler, it seems as if he was just bored and decided to get in the studio. There isn't any melodies, drum patterns. This is not music at all. I do not recommend this album, Buy it at your own risk."
neg,"This album is crap, how is this better than j cole's. You can't even understand the lyrics, it's just a bunch of loud screaming. I laugh at the people who say this is innovation, this cannot even be called music"
neg,"Complete garbage... Ive tried to like this album. I listened to it 3 times. The beats, the lyrics, the overall feel of the album is just wack. Kanye needs to go back to his late registration college dropout days because this just sounds like noise."
pos,"Some people didn't get this album simply because they weren't ready for it. This album is absolutely timeless; it did the same thing for music as stravinsky did with the rite of spring, or miles davis with bitches brew. This album is THAT significant. It's a great headphones album while lying in bed, check it out in a very comfortable, alone, place."
pos,"this album is symptomatic of post 'ok computer' radiohead. the stuff thats good is fantastic (everything in its right place, optomistic) and whats bad is rubbish (kid a, treefingers). overall i would say its one half genius, one half muck but the genius half alone makes it worth the effort."
pos,"Uhm. Do I even have to say anything at this point? If you don't like this record, you either A) Don't like music. B) Don't understand artists or C) Loved the last Puddle of Mudd Cd. Buy it. Love it. Have sex to it. Drive to it. Show it to everyone you know. And if they don't like it? Stop talking to them. Even if they are your father. He's just not cool enough."
pos,"Kid A is an absolute masterpiece of infinite depth and complexity. There are some really quite incredible albums out there, but i would have to say that this is probably the best. I know people who have written hundreds of pages of A4 on the analysis of this album and still failed to break the ice. Of course, to enjoy and appreciate it's beauty you have to remain open-minded. It is not something you are bound to like upon the first hearing. As with all rewarding experiences, it takes time - but patience is a virtue. "
pos,"I had no choice but to like this album ; It took me on a ride. I couldnt form my feelings about it into words if I wanted to it just feels perfect from beginning to end. Its bewitching. With this album and Amnesiac, we were treated to a rare thing - something completely true and a real work of art that came out of popular music."
pos,"Excellent tracks throughout. As ever with Radiohead albums, a CD you can put on and listen to over and over and over again and love it every time. Idioteque is one of their best ever."
pos,"Intricate, Beautiful, divine and perfect. The sound grows on you over time, leaving you breathless and sobbing with joy."
neg,"This is the worst album i have ever heard. It sounds like Kanye just went in the studio and said it, lets just make some noise and put my name on it. Do not pay for this trash."
neg,"Critics you can't be serious, this album is trash and this isn't music. All of Kanye's previous albums outdo this one by a long shot. Kanye is getting confused with believing in a God and thinking he is God."
neg,"Yet another example as to how West is the absolute epitome of talentless douchebag...but thankfully, the world smartened up and also made this album a commercial failure. The man needs to give up...he has yet to record anything worthwhile...how critics continue to misdirect praise to this joke of an ""artist"" is beyond me. The man is all ego, ZERO substance. This album is, like all his albums, horrifyingly terrible"
pos,"I'm drunk right now, but at the moment I feel like crucifying all of the critcswho gave this a bad rating. I wonder if they've ever experienced a wonderful day or a totally euphoric moment of any kind. The only conclusion I can draw from these negative reviews is that the people writing them are not human. It's true, androids--its the only answer. I'm drunk. Fuck this album with your pants off and live forever. "
pos,"its genius. q magazine gave this 3 out of 5 and then it got vited the 10th best album ever last year in their own magazine, oh the irony. this album is a work of art, it leaves coldplay, snow patrol and keane other heart on sleeve bands trailing in their dust. absolute brilliance. then they follow it up with the unbelievable ammnesiac and the very underrated hail to the thief, i for one cannot wait for this years new album, which contains perhaps their greatest ever song nude."
pos,Could this band ever possible do any wrong? Theyre completely different... and no one could argue that. I can see if they dont quite understand why they are so brilliant... but you cant deny that this band isnt exactly that! This band truely has no comparisions.
pos,"Still an amazing record. It kind of feels that some of those that criticize the album do on the basis theres no 'creep,' or that because they've heard autechre and aphex twin they have license to completely trash the record. big fucking deal. regardless of total originality, the songwriting and structure is incredible."
pos,Brave and Brilliant. Kid A is as good as The Bends and OK Computer and sounds like a band that is capable of anything. Radiohead are truly the geniuses of our generation.
pos,"I don't know, Brian. The Moon and Antartica is an amazing cd. But Radiohead really can't be compared to anything. They're our generation's perfect band. Every cd they release is just about perfect. Nothing can match OK Computer, though."
pos,A brillant and thought-provoking album. This is a radical departure from Radioheads past work but Kid A is actually a logical progression from OK Computer because of the increasing computer uses in OK Computer. What comesa out of Kid A is a beautiful and innovative album. Tracks such as Everything In Its Right Place and NAtional Anhthem simmer with genius.
pos,"I registered only to say that ""Kid A"" is not only best album ever but the best parallel universe dimension. I listened to it stoned and I traveled everywhere. Thanks Radiohead! And all these shitty critic are only closed minded people. This record changed my life. And did anyone catch how great is on repeat? Because ""main character"" dies in last song, but when you put record in ""repeat"" mode it doesn't he wakes up semi drunk from pills and red wine in last song sucking a lemon. Greatest album ever, and what to say about landscapes. OMG. I saw Rainbows, my head was on stick I was in bunker with lots of children and womans. Thank you Radiohead again. Sorry about bad English. Kiss to all fans from Croatia. "
pos,"Arguably the band's finest album yet, a follow-up to the already fantastic OK Computer. The album's electronica edge lost them some fans, but the eletronica tunes succeed (""Idioteque,"" ""Morning Bell,"" ""Everything in its Right Place""), as do more conventional rockers like ""Optimistic."" The best album of the new millennium thus far.
"
pos,"Although, this album may appear challenging, cold and at times distant, it is the intricate and lively percussion effects and generous use of the ondes martenot, that combine radiohead's avant garde electronica, with their more popular alternative rock."
neg,"This is total rubbish... it's not music, it's just some moron rapping stupidity over boring repetitive drum beats. it's not even music, it just sounds like when you accidentally play a few youtube videos at once.
"
neg,"This album has little to offer and I am very disappointed in Kanye. With only 10 tracks on the album, it is a rip-off to even purchase. Not only are there just 10 tracks, it sounds like he recorded the entire album in an echoing gymnasium 3 hours before the album was due to his label. Kanye said he didn't want it to be radio-style music, but you can still make good songs without sounding radio-friendly. In ""Blood On the Leaves"", he sounds like a bad version of T-Pain, sounding even more generic than T-Pain himself. Overall the album leaves much to be desired from the rapper who previously never failed to impress me. In my opinion the worst thing he ever could have done for his career was get married and have a child. "
neg,"Overly produced. Lyrics were outright pathetic. Couple decent songs. No replay value for me. I understand he wants to go outside the boundaries of hip-hop, but I can't even give this a pass."
neg,"Maybe the best album form kanye, i mean his wordplay is amazing, his screaming is on another level, genius cause he has a penius, see that wordplay, masterpiece"
pos,"A few great songs, and as a whole it's quite solid, but due to its lack of accessibility (took me a good few listens to get into it) I'd say it's one of their weaker albums. Although it's still really good."
pos,"Stunning album from the world's finest. Not a single weak track on this album (Yes, even Treefingers). It starts with 2 electronic masterpieces which sets you up for the rest of the album. Quality in every department. ""How to Disappear Completely"" is a stunning song and one of Radiohead's best."
pos,"This, is in my opinion, one of the greatest cds of all time. The group gos through unconvential methods to create mood. Some say a lack of obvious lyrical intentions hurt the music but when is music just about lyrics. 95% of bands out there today have nothing new to say and if put in persective really dont make to much sense either"
pos,Though not as good as the masterpiece OK Computer. This album is innovative and very experimental. Most of the songs are mindblowing besides a few filler songs such as Treefingers. Listen to this album with a open mind.
pos,"Flawless. I've listened to it hundreds of times and it never gets old. Radioheads best album. Every song has beautiful vocals and perfectly anomous vocals. People need to grow up and accept music that isn't mainstream and guitar based. ""How to Disappear Completely"" is the ""A Day in the Life"" of today."
pos,Kid A is a masterpiece. I rank it high up alongside Dark Side of the Moon as one of the best albums I've ever heard.
pos,"Kid A is a masterpiece that pushes the envelope of OK computer even further. Considering the fact that OK computer was an experimental album that received critical acclaim, some people are being overly harsh towards Radiohead for being creative. Go listen to your mainstream music, and let me bask in the glory that is originality. I love Radiohead, and will continue to support them. Good job boys."
neg,"This is a weed plate...Something I'd use to break buds on...The only people who would find this album ""revolutionary"" are people who aren't familiar with anything outside of top 40...He's biting styles left and right, but his take on other genres is sub-par to put it nicely...and the lyrics...bwahaha!...Kanye is the type of guy that would have a baby with Kim Kardashian...enough said"
neg,How in the universe of music does this album have a more positive score than that of J. cole's Born Sinner? This album is trash and it should not be bought by anyone who listens to Hip-Hop music. I don't have a problem if a person wants to do something different with their music just make sure it's good. This is a lyrical failure he is capable of sooooo much better but he did not put is all in this album at all. I am not a Kayne hater I loved every album that he has done before this one even 808's and heartbrakes that was actually a good album but this....This is trash do not buy and Rate J Cole's Born Sinner higher because it is a much better album than this one. 
neg,"I don't recall listening to a worst album than this one. It is unbelievable how most critics can't tell a rubbish record from revolutionary one. So disappointing. There is no highlight in this album. The lyrics are terrible, so is the production and the music in general. I cannot believe RS ranked it on the second position of 2013's best albums. This magazine and these new audiences are destroying what once we knew as great, enjoyable music."
pos,"Now that a few years and some passions passed, that you listened to the new sound of Radiohead, please listen this album once again, in entirety, without passing from one track to the other (it is a masterwork, an entity, not a succession of titles). Then! it is still not one of best the album of all times?"
pos,"This was the first radiohead album I heard back in 2000, and I certainly enjoyed it at the time and listened to it a good deal. Since then, I've listened to the rest of radiohead's work and over 300 other albums from the 90s, 80s, 70s and a few from the 60s that I would consider good music (i.e. not manufactured formula-rock/teen-angst nonsense). Recently, I threw this in my CD player after having not listened to radiohead for about a year. Now you'll have to forgive me for gushing a little bit, even if I'm not as eloquent as a rock critic. It knocked me squarely on my ass, to be blunt. I heard so many aspects I never could have considered before, and the realization of the overall artistic depth here gave me goosebumps. To put it simply, I was enjoying the album on a entirely different level than I had 3 years prior. On one point from the pitchfork review I couldn't agree more: this album makes ordinary ""rock and roll"" childish. Art; utter genius from start to finish; masterpiece. One for the time capsule indeed. Like anyone, my musical tastes change over time, but after 3 years of hindsight and having sampled a great deal of rock with varying levels of artistic merit, emotional potency, songcraft and sheer beauty, (e.g. talking heads, olivia tremor control, talk talk, my bloody valentine, pavement, yo la tengo, can) I can't help but declare it flat-out: Kid A is the greatest album I've ever heard. I have a feeling it will stay that way for quite some time."
pos,"Greatest Album ever? In my opinion, possibly! However like good wine of cheese is definately an aquired taste, so not for everyone. So if you like Pink Floyd, The Pixies, Bob Dylan, Nick Cave, The Smiths and later Beatles albums then give this a listen, however if you like Britney, Blink 182 or any other artist or group that makes it on to MTV 1 then avoid, it will only confuse and frustrate you!"
pos,"This is the best album in the history of mankind. Every song on this album deserves it's own 500 word essay, but I believe ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" stands out the most of all the songs. Its minimalist silece in the middle is so amazing to listen to. Radiohead is genius."
pos,"This is the most important album of our generation, hands down. Radiohead, moving from a mostly unremarkable alt. rock band on Pablo Honey to a positive force in a hackneyed genre with The Bends and OK Computer, have singlehandedly redefined the landscape of marketable, and even remarkable music. This is an undeniably amazing album from a band who deserves every accolade that's been heaped on them."
neg,This album is Grade-A trash. The lyrics are absolutely terrible and the production is so so. This is coming from a Kanye fan btw. I love all of his other albums but this is a disgrace and the only reason people think this is good is because Kanye made it. If B.o.B or Kid Cudi had made this these same people would be trashing it.
neg,"Just trash period. Listen to the actual album its really trash, it only has two hit songs which include bound 2 and blood on the leaves. It has a really annoying buzzing sound and just terrible."
neg,"Dull, boring and pathetic and that's just Kanye. This is quite possibly one of the worst excuses for an album though to be fair none of his albums are awful so this is no surprise."
pos,"One of the best CDs of all time. Not as good as OK Computer, but nothing is."
pos,"Amazing how this release polarizes Radiohead fans. I ""liked"" OK Computer, but Kid A wasn't something that you can compare to other releases...even by Radiohead. It is something that is in it's own space and time. If you are looking for these guys to ""rock"", don't bother. Listen to this with open ears, and you will be amazed. For those who like to be challenged by music."
pos,"Radiohead's first electronica CD is absolutely brilliant. Spawned by their discovery of Sigur Ros, Radiohead decided to become even more unique than they already were. This isn't as good as The Bends or Ok Computer, but any fan of electronica music or Radiohead in general should check this out."
neg,"So after reading all about this critical darling making the number one album of the year in various respected publications, I finally listened to Kanye's Yeezus album. 

Admittedly, synthetic is not my usual stomping ground, however I did find his music what I would consider somewhere within the realm of compelling, although not quite genius. I could delve into my praises more specifically, but I'm not. In fact, my praises are going to come to an abrupt, deliberately dismissive stop right now. 

This dude's lyrical message is trash in the most absolute sense. I find it so detestable, the only way I'd ever purchase this album would be if this crybaby ""genius"" invented a machine to go back in time to his studio, and re-used these beats to make cover versions of twinkle twinkle little star and mary had a little lamb. I'm not going to waste my money or time to hear some self righteous, ego maniacal, man-infant-supremacist perform a racist rant. Quite frankly, it's defamatory to me as a human being. 

The universal acclaim for this album among indie music critics has revealed a highly accomplished field of predominantly white male jackasses who's primary skill in life seems to be outsmarting themselves. All you awesome artsy fartsy indie hipsters in love with this pile of excrement have revealed so much I wish I never knew about your socially depraved mindset. The desperation to be accepted by black people must be incredibly overwhelming to appropriate such wretchedness. I'd ask God to have mercy on your nerdy little beta male souls but why bother? Most of you are atheists anyway. 

Your Baby ""Yeezus"" belongs in a barbed wire playpen, with a digital rattle so it can best express his musical genius. Gently toss in a bottle of baby formula hopefully spiked with arsenic for this rat to suckle on, and I think we may have finally taken an appropriate step toward cleaning house in the music world. To see this dude's career riding first class on a one horse open sleigh to hell would be the best Christmas present the world could ask for. I'm flushing this God-Turd like a half eaten, partially decomposed dead feeder goldfish. 

Turn out the lights on this one. This album is a shameful waste of time for any human being with a half-shred of dignity. "
pos,"Without a doubt, the single best record of the millennium, and one of the best of all time. Radiohead could have easily followed up with ""OK Computer"" II, but they did what impresses me more than anything a band could do. They completely destroyed their already phenomenal (and at one time superior, only on ""OK Computer"") sound, and completely reinvented it. The guts to do that is unbelievable. It's not like Red Hot Chili Peppers' backwards movement from funk-rock rapping to melodic pop-rock, it was a risky movement, in contrast to their very safe move to more popularity. Radiohead could easily have ruined their careers with this album. It was a bold move. However, they did nothing near destroy their careers. Sure, they lost some fans to this abrupt change in course, but out with the old in with the new (and more intelligent in this case, haha) I always say. Through all Jonny Greenwood's magnificent guitar work, which is all incredibly impressive, I really think his mostly electronic synth work on ""Kid A"" is where he draws the fine line between being a great guitarist, and a genius. The whole album is a 21st century masterpiece. It honestly got me into liking electronic music (the electro-rock eased me into more pure electronic quickly). SImply, it's a must-have."
pos,"Their best album yet, not one song on it was bad. Each song complimented the other songs really well. Although my initial reaction after listening to it for the first time was pretty negative. I thought it was one of their weaker albums, but after a few more listens it really grew on me. Excellent album.

neg,"This project is very weird and un-settling. It offers poor lyricism and can only be described as what sounds like Kanye rapping and yelling over sounds that many producers would instantly skip if they were to come across them. The only thing saving this project are songs such as ""Bound 2"" and ""Blood On the Leaves""."
neg,"Kanye what the fuck You've failed in almost every aspect! Your wordplay is trash, your lyrics are trash, and your beats are especially garbage!! The only reason I don't completely hate this album is because Blood on the Leaves is a good song"
